  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), alternately known as drones, have been extensively used in various applications such as security, traffic patrolling, aerial photography, power line inspection, remote sensing, and many more. The continuous request for safer, faster, and more economical solutions to monitor and respond in critical, wide-area, and rugged terrain and road conditions increases the attention on drone patrolling in surveillance, disaster management, and search and rescue applications. Traditional patrolling has the limitations of high cost, limited coverage, and potentially dangerous for human presence. Considering these limitations, there has been a growing enthusiasm to mitigate the aforementioned problems through the utilization of drone patrolling technology. However, finding publications that aggregate information on current drone patrol applications, advantages and disadvantages, and possible challenges in the literature is difficult. This paper provides a review study highlighting the advantages of drone patrolling applications and the difficulties of deploying them. It also offers recommendations for future research to address these difficulties. This research compares the traditional patrolling systems and the new systems using drones. The uses for autonomous drone patrols are then listed. Furthermore, we outline the difficulties that drone patrolling is facing, the problems that impact the effectiveness, and adaptability of this system. Finally, future and potential further studies on drone patrolling were discussed. We believe this review will further motivate other researchers to enhance drone patrolling functionality and performance.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the decentralized strategy followed to ensure information propagation in area monitoring missions with a fleet of heterogeneous UAVs with limited communication range. The goal of the team is to detect pollution sources over a large area as soon as possible. Hence the elapsed time between two consecutive visits should be minimized. On the other hand, in order to exploit the capabilities derived from having a fleet of UAVs, an efficient area partition is performed in a distributed manner using a one-to-one coordination schema according to the limited communication ranges. Another requirement is to have the whole team informed about the location of the new pollution sources detected. This requirement is challenging because the communication range of the vehicles is small compared to the area covered in the mission. Sufficient and necessary conditions are provided to guarantee one-to-one UAV communication in grid-shape area partitions, allowing to share any new information among all the members of the team, even under strong communication constraints. The proposed decentralized strategy has been simulated to confirm that fulfils all the goals and requirements and has been also compared to other patrolling strategies.},

  abstract = {The fast and cost-efficient home delivery of goods ordered online is logistically challenging. Many companies are looking for new ways to cross the last mile to their customers. One technology-enabled opportunity that recently has received much attention is the use of drones to support deliveries. An innovative last-mile delivery concept in which a truck collaborates with a drone to make deliveries gives rise to a new variant of the traveling salesman problem (TSP) that we call the TSP with drone. In this paper, we model this problem as an integer program and develop several fast route-first, cluster-second heuristics based on local search and dynamic programming. We prove worst-case approximation ratios for the heuristics and test their performance by comparing the solutions to the optimal solutions for small instances. In addition, we apply our heuristics to several artificial instances with different characteristics and sizes. Our experiments show that substantial savings are possible with this concept compared to truck-only delivery. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/trsc.2017.0791.},

  abstract = {This study expands on the investigation of the vehicle routing problem with cross-dock (VRPCD) by incorporating disruption in a network with suppliers, customers, and a single cross-dock. It is assumed that the disruption (e.g., traffic accident or mechanical failure) impacts the scheduled pickup times of vehicles carrying freight; hence, pickup or delivery is affected by late vehicle arrivals to suppliers, cross-docks, and customers as well as increased transportation cost for the carrier. To help decision makers mitigate the impact of this type of disruption, mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) are developed to model VRPCD with time-window constraints under both normal and disrupted conditions that will quantify the impact of disruption. The Golden Ball metaheuristic is adapted to provide an optimal or near-optimal solution of the MILPs in a short time period. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithms, numerical experiments are performed on hypothetical networks containing a realistic number of pickup and delivery locations. Results from numerical experiments and ANOVA analysis showed that: 1) the cross-dock is able to cope with the disruption when the number of disrupted nodes is small, 2) early breakdown of an inbound vehicle with fewer nodes on its routes causes smaller service delays, 3) as the number of disrupted nodes increases, it is advantageous to reroute outbound vehicles, and 4) when the breakdown occurs earlier in the planning horizon, it is better to reroute both inbound and outbound vehicles whereas only outbound vehicles should be rerouted when the breakdown happens later in the day.},

However, computing a kernel density estimate is computationally intensive for large crime datasets, and the quality of the resulting estimate depends heavily on parameters that are difficult to set manually. Inspired by methods from image processing, we propose a novel way for performing hotspot analysis using localized kernel density estimation optimized with an evolutionary algorithm. The proposed method uses local learning to address three challenges associated with traditional kernel density estimation: computational complexity, bandwidth selection, and kernel function selection. We evaluate our localized kernel model on 17 crime types from Chicago, Illinois, USA. Preliminary results indicate significant improvement in prediction performance over the traditional approach. We also examine the effect of data sparseness on the performance of both models.},

We assume that the edges have the same length, and that traveling along an edge takes a unit of time. Two objective functions are considered: the cover time and the cover length. The cover time is the maximum time a robot needs to finish its assigned walk and the cover length is the sum of the lengths of all the walks. We also consider a variant in which the robots must rendezvous periodically at the same vertex in at most a certain number of moves. We show that the problem is different for the two cost functions. For the cover time minimization problem, we prove that the problem is NP-hard when k is part of the input, regardless of whether periodic rendezvous are required or not. For the cover length minimization problem, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time when periodic rendezvous are not required, and it is NP-hard otherwise.},

Our focus in this paper is exploring environment to accomplish tasks distributed over the environment by minimizing overall cost of the system. This problem is defined as a NP-Hard problem, thus will be more challenging in larger environments containing many robots and tasks. To solve multi-robot task allocation in very large environment we propose a new deployment-based framework. Our proposal divided the problem into two sub-problems: region partitioning and routing problem. This decomposition eases considering our problem specification in multi-robot system which are not easily considerable in other approaches, i.e distribution of the tasks or robots’ initial position. Load balancing is done globally by deploying robots in a proper location of the environment and assigning sub-regions among them. Sub-regions contains set of points, where the goal is visiting all the points individually by one of the robots. On the other hand, after deploying the robots, routing techniques can be simply applied to find shortest and safest paths for every robots. To search for solutions in this NP-hard problem, two methods are built on a tailor-made multi-objective scheme of Genetic Algorithm (GA) with a different setup and search operators, and a reinforcement learning approach. Simulation results testify the performance of our methods in comparison to existing ones.},

In this note, we modify the problem by allowing the Attacker to go to his planned attack location early and observe the presence or the absence there of the Patroller (who wears a uniform). To avoid being too predictable, the Patroller may sometimes remain at her base when she could have been visiting a possible attack location. The Attacker can then choose to delay attacking for some number of periods after the Patroller leaves his planned attack location. As shown here, this extra information for the Attacker can reduce thwarted attacks by as much as a factor of four in some cases. Our main finding is that the attack should begin in the second period the Patroller is away and the Patroller should never visit the same location (other than her base) in consecutive periods.},

The Attacker chooses a point of Q (not necessarily a node) to attack during a chosen time interval of fixed duration. The Patroller chooses a unit speed path on Q and intercepts the attack (and wins) if she visits the attacked point during the attack-time interval. This zero-sum game models the problem of protecting roads or pipelines from an adversarial attack. The payoff to the maximizing Patroller is the probability that the attack is intercepted. Our results include the following: (i) a solution to the game for any network Q, as long as the time required to carry out the attack is sufficiently short; (ii) a solution to the game for all tree networks that satisfy a certain condition on their extremities; and (iii) a solution to the game for any attack duration for stars with one long arc and the remaining arcs equal in length.

He requires m consecutive periods there, uninterrupted by the Patroller, to commit his nefarious act (and win). The Patroller can follow any path on the graph. Thus, the patrolling game is a win-lose game, where the Value is the probability that the Patroller successfully intercepts an attack, given best play on both sides.

This disassembly plan optimises sequences to minimise operation time and the disassembling costs of end-of-life (EoL) products. Combining different data-driven decision-making tools, the plan aims to handle the complexities and uncertainties of disassembly tasks. Based on the physical features and geometric limitations of EoL product components, we calculate product disassembly difficulty scores. Subsequently, the deep reinforcement learning model integrates these scores into planning process. The model allocates tasks in real time according to the online conditions of the human operator, cobot, and product, enabling the model to cope with uncertainties that may change the process routine. We also present different scenarios wherein a cobot collaborates with human operators with different skill levels. To evaluate model performance, we compare it with baseline models in terms of the convergence time and incorporated disassembly features. The analysis indicates that our model converges three times faster than a baseline model applied to the same case study. Moreover, our model includes more features of the disassembly problem in its decision-making process than any other baseline model.},

  abstract = {Decentralized planning in uncertain environments is a complex task generally dealt with by using a decision-theoretic approach, mainly through the framework of Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DEC-POMDPs). Although DEC-POMDPS are a general and powerful modeling tool, solving them is a task with an overwhelming complexity that can be doubly exponential. In this paper, we study an alternate formulation of DEC-POMDPs relying on a sequence-form representation of policies. From this formulation, we show how to derive Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems that, once solved, give exact optimal solutions to the DEC-POMDPs. We show that these MILPs can be derived either by using some combinatorial characteristics of the optimal solutions of the DEC-POMDPs or by using concepts borrowed from game theory. Through an experimental validation on classical test problems from the DEC-POMDP literature, we compare our approach to existing algorithms. Results show that mathematical programming outperforms dynamic programming but is less efficient than forward search, except for some particular problems. The main contributions of this work are the use of mathematical programming for DEC-POMDPs and a better understanding of DEC-POMDPs and of their solutions. Besides, we argue that our alternate representation of DEC-POMDPs could be helpful for designing novel algorithms looking for approximate solutions to DEC-POMDPs.},

  abstract = {Disaster management generally includes the post-disaster stage, which consists of the actions taken in response to the disaster damages. These actions include the employment of emergency plans and assigned resources to (i) rescue affected people immediately, (ii) deliver personnel, medical care and equipment to the disaster area, and (iii) aid to prevent the infrastructural and environmental losses. In the response phase, humanitarian logistics directly influence the efficiency of the relief operation. Ambulances routing problem is defined as employing the optimisation tools to manage the flow of ambulances for finding the best ambulance tours to transport the injured to hospitals. Researchers pointed out the importance of equity and fairness in humanitarian relief services: managing the operations of ambulances in the immediate aftermath of a disaster must be done impartially and efficiently to rescue affected people with different priority in accordance with the restrictions. Our research aim is to find the best ambulance tours to transport the patients during a disaster in relief operations while considering fairness and equity to deliver services to patients in balance. The problem is formulated as a new variant of the team orienteering problem with hierarchical objectives to address also the efficiency issue. Due to the limitation of solving the proposed model using a general-purpose solver, we propose a new hybrid algorithm based on a machine learning and neighbourhood search. Based on a new set of realistic benchmark instances, our quantitative analysis proves that our algorithm is capable to largely reduce the solution running time especially when the complexity of the problem increases. Further, a comparison between the fair solution and the system optimum solution is also provided.},

  abstract = {The trend toward shorter delivery lead times reduces operational efficiency and increases transportation costs for Internet retailers. However, mobile technology creates new opportunities to organize the last mile. In this paper, we study the concept of crowdsourced delivery that aims to use excess capacity on journeys that already take place. We consider a service platform that automatically creates matches between parcel delivery tasks and ad hoc drivers. The platform also operates a fleet of dedicated vehicles to serve the tasks that cannot be served by the ad hoc drivers. The matching of tasks, drivers, and dedicated vehicles in real time gives rise to a new variant of the dynamic pickup and delivery problem. We propose a rolling horizon framework and develop an exact solution approach to solve the matching problem each time new information becomes available. To investigate the potential benefit of crowdsourced delivery, we conduct a wide range of computational experiments. The experiments provide insights into the viability of crowdsourced delivery under various assumptions about the behavior of the ad hoc drivers. The results suggest that the use of ad hoc drivers has the potential to make the last mile more cost-efficient and can provide system-wide vehicle-mile savings up to 37\% compared to a traditional delivery system with dedicated vehicles.},

  abstract = {The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) in populated cities is increasing in response to reducing the environmental impact of transportation; however, it also brings new problems to be solved that require innovative solutions such as the optimal use of charged vehicles, the location of charging stations, and managing transportation disruptions in a dynamic environment. This study addresses the problem of recovering a pre-established schedule of an EV when an unexpected disruption occurs. The innovative idea for this problem is reconfiguring the road network by skipping one or more customers while locating alternative points for the temporary storage of consignments initially scheduled to be picked up from (or delivered to) skipped destinations. It is allowed to assign lockers to a neighborhood entailing a set of nodes. This paper designs an integrated form of EV routing problem that simultaneously determines the optimal velocity in each assigned route and the battery recharging policy under a partial charging scheme. The paper also proposes an efficient algorithm based on the Crowd-Learning Particle Swarm Optimization (CLPSO) to solve the large-scale problem. The proposed algorithm surpassed a set of widely used algorithms in the literature using a numerical case study. Computational experiments, based on data from a freight company, demonstrate the effectiveness of the model and CLPSO algorithm. The test results confirm that the developed approach can be a useful reference in practice to provide a robust operation of EVs in metropolitans and populated cities. The results also show that applying all of the proposed recovery actions can significantly reduce the cost of the disruption.},

In an attempt to solve this problem, a binary integer programming model is developed, whose objective is to maximize the expected vehicle coverage across the network. The model dynamically locates patrol units through a fixed time horizon, subject to movement and location constraints, considering a probability of not being able to attend to an attack, due to a distance factor. A chronological decomposition heuristic is developed, and achieves an optimality gap of less than 1~\%, in less than 5~min. The problem is also solved by developing a geographical decomposition heuristic. To introduce a measure of equity, two sets of constraints are proposed. Three measures are considered: total vehicle coverage, inequity and network coverage. A trade-off between these three measures is observed and discussed. Finally, scalability of the model is explored, using decomposition in terms of patrolling units, until we obtain subproblems of equal size as the original instance. All of these features are applied to a case study in Northern Israel. In the last section, some adaptations and additions to the model that can be made in further research are discussed.},

A solution is a tour determined before the vehicle departs from the depot. The objective is to maximize the sum of the collected prizes net of the expected penalty. The randomness of the travel and service times is modeled by a set of scenarios based on historical data that can be collected from public geographical information services.

The second part of the study presents a detailed analysis of the currently available commercial simulation software solutions for developing DT models in manufacturing systems for HRC scenarios. The analysis encompassed various aspects such as: the software's capabilities in human and robot simulation, ergonomic and time measurements analysis, data exchange and interoperability with the physical world as well as with other software. The results of the analysis are meant to provide practical insights to researchers and practitioners interested in implementing DTs to enhance HRC in manufacturing systems.},

  abstract = {Search operations performed by adaptive autonomous maritime vehicles have been a topic of considerable interest for many years. Such operations require carefully scheduled coordination of multiple vehicles performing search tasks across the region of interest. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the maritime environment, however, an initially planned search schedule may not be maintained if the vehicles have significant capability to adapt their tasks to match the environment they detect in real time. We propose a multi-vehicle adaptive algorithm for dynamic evaluation and elastic re-planning of variable-length tasks commonly found in the maritime environments. In adaptive evaluation and re-planning problems, a set of tasks are initially planned for execution by adaptive, autonomous search vehicles. Tasks are allocated to search vehicles under a pre-defined schedule based on prior knowledge and desired outcome. Because of the vehicles’ autonomy and reactivity to in situ conditions such as environment or target pose, the precise duration and actions required by each task are unknown a priori. We develop a hidden Markov model (HMM) for propagating task estimates, coupled with a quadratic-programming-based elastic re-scheduler. The result is an integrated estimate-and-schedule adaptation scheme that quickly and efficiently re-plans the vehicles’ schedules based on in situ observations. The numerical simulation results show that this novel HMM approach decreases avoidable schedule variation by over a factor of two compared to existing methods.},

Reoptimization, that is, the concept of making use of a known solution to an optimization problem instance when the solution to a similar problem instance is sought, is a promising and rather new research field in this application domain. However, so far no approximative time-extended MRTA solution approaches exist for which guarantees on the resulting solution's quality can be given. We investigate the reoptimization problems of inserting as well as deleting a task to/from a time-extended MRTA problem instance. For both problems, we can give performance guarantees in the form of an upper bound of 2 on the resulting approximation ratio for all heuristics fulfilling a mild assumption. We furthermore introduce specific solution heuristics and prove that smaller and tight upper bounds on the approximation ratio can be given for these heuristics if only temporal unconstrained tasks and homogeneous groups of robots are considered. A conclusory evaluation of the reoptimization heuristic demonstrates a near-to-optimal performance in application.},

Time-extended multi-robot task allocation approaches assign and schedule a set of tasks to a group of robots such that certain objectives are optimized and operational constraints are met. This is particularly challenging if cooperative tasks, i.e. tasks that require two or more robots to work directly together, are considered. In this paper, we present an easy-to-implement criterion to validate the feasibility, i.e. executability, of solutions to time-extended multi-robot task allocation problems with cross schedule dependencies arising from the consideration of cooperative tasks and precedence constraints. Using the introduced feasibility criterion, we propose a local improvement heuristic based on a neighborhood operator for the problem class under consideration. The initial solution is obtained by a greedy constructive heuristic. Both methods use a generalized cost structure and are therefore able to handle various objective function instances. We evaluate the proposed approach using test scenarios of different problem sizes, all comprising the complexity aspects of the regarded problem. The simulation results illustrate the improvement potential arising from the application of the local improvement heuristic.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the potential of a multidisciplinary approach to testing and aligning artificial intelligence (AI), specifically focusing on large language models (LLMs). Due to the rapid development and wide application of LLMs, challenges such as ethical alignment, controllability, and predictability of these models emerged as global risks. This study investigates an innovative simulation-based multi-agent system within a virtual reality framework that replicates the real-world environment. The framework is populated by automated 'digital citizens,' simulating complex social structures and interactions to examine and optimize AI. Application of various theories from the fields of sociology, social psychology, computer science, physics, biology, and economics demonstrates the possibility of a more human-aligned and socially responsible AI. The purpose of such a digital environment is to provide a dynamic platform where advanced AI agents can interact and make independent decisions, thereby mimicking realistic scenarios. The actors in this digital city, operated by the LLMs, serve as the primary agents, exhibiting high degrees of autonomy. While this approach shows immense potential, there are notable challenges and limitations, most significantly the unpredictable nature of real-world social dynamics. This research endeavors to contribute to the development and refinement of AI, emphasizing the integration of social, ethical, and theoretical dimensions for future research.},

The appeal of focusing limited resources on a small number of high-activity crime places is straightforward. If crime can be prevented at these hot spots, then citywide crime totals could be reduced. Objectives To assess the effects of focused police crime prevention interventions at crime hot spots. The review also examined whether focused police actions at specific locations result in crime displacement (i.e., crime moving around the corner) or diffusion (i.e., crime reduction in surrounding areas) of crime control benefits. Search Methods A keyword search was performed on 15 abstract databases. Bibliographies of past narrative and empirical reviews of literature that examined the effectiveness of police crime control programs were reviewed and forward searches for works that cited seminal hot spots policing studies were performed. Bibliographies of past completed Campbell systematic reviews of police crime prevention efforts were reviewed and hand searches of leading journals in the field were completed. Experts in the field were consulted and relevant citations were obtained. Selection Criteria To be eligible for this review, interventions used to control crime hot spots were limited to police-led prevention efforts. Suitable police-led crime prevention efforts included traditional tactics such as directed patrol and heightened levels of traffic enforcement as well as alternative strategies such as aggressive disorder enforcement and problem-oriented policing. Studies that used randomized controlled experimental or quasiexperimental designs were selected. The units of analysis were limited to crime hot spots or high-activity crime “places” rather than larger areas such as neighborhoods. The control group in each study received routine levels of traditional police crime prevention tactics. Data Collection and Analysis Sixty-five studies containing 78 tests of hot spots policing interventions were identified and full narratives of these studies were reported. Twenty-seven of the selected studies used randomized experimental designs and 38 used quasiexperimental designs. A formal meta-analysis was conducted to determine the crime prevention effects in the eligible studies. Random effects models were used to calculate mean effect sizes. Results Sixty-two of 78 tests of hot spots policing interventions reported noteworthy crime and disorder reductions. The meta-analysis of key reported outcome measures revealed a small statistically significant mean effect size favoring the effects of hot spots policing in reducing crime outcomes at treatment places relative to control places. The effect was smaller for randomized designs but still statistically significant and positive. When displacement and diffusion effects were measured, a diffusion of crime prevention benefits was associated with hot spots policing. Authors' Conclusions The extant evaluation research suggests that hot spots policing is an effective crime prevention strategy. The research also suggests that focusing police efforts on high-activity crime places does not inevitably lead to crime displacement; rather, crime control benefits may diffuse into the areas immediately surrounding the targeted locations.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: We consider the case of prescriptive policing, that is, the data-driven assignment of police cars to different areas of a city. We analyze key problems with respect to prediction, optimization, and evaluation as well as trade-offs between different quality measures and crime types. Academic/practical relevance: Data-driven prescriptive analytics is gaining substantial attention in operations management research, and effective policing is at the core of the operations of almost every city in the world. Given the vast amounts of data increasingly collected within smart city initiatives and the growing safety challenges faced by urban centers worldwide, our work provides novel insights on the development and evaluation of prescriptive analytics applications in an urban context. Methodology: We conduct a computational study using crime and auxiliary data on the city of San Francisco. We analyze both strong and weak prediction methods along with two optimization formulations representing the deterrence and response time impact of police vehicle allocations. We analyze trade-offs between these effects and between different crime types. Results: We find that even weaker prediction methods can produce Pareto-efficient outcomes with respect to deterrence and response time. We identify three different archetypes of combinations of prediction methods and optimization objectives that constitute the Pareto frontier among the configurations we analyze. Furthermore, optimizing for multiple crime types biases allocations in a way that generally decreases single-type performance along one outcome metric but can improve it along the other. Managerial implications: Although optimization integrating all relevant crime types is theoretically possible, it is practically challenging because each crime type requires a collectively consistent weight. We present a framework combining prediction and optimization for a subset of key crime types with exploring the impact on the remaining types to support implementation of operations-focused smart city solutions in practice.},

A Decision Support System (DSS) can help to optimize effective use of the scarce human resources available. In this paper we present a DSS that merges predictive policing capabilities with a patrolling districting model, for the design of predictive patrolling areas. The proposed DSS, developed in close collaboration with the Spanish National Police Corps (SNPC), defines partitions of the territory under the jurisdiction of a district that are efficient and balanced at the same time, according to the preferences of a decision maker. To analyze the crime records provided by the SNPC, a methodology for the description of spatially and temporally indeterminate crime events has been developed. The DSS has been tested with a case study in the Central District of Madrid. The results of the experiments show that the proposed DSS clearly outperforms the patrolling area definitions currently in use by the SNPC. To compare the solutions in terms of efficiency loss, we discuss how to build an operational envelope for the problem considered, which can be used to identify the range of performances associated with different patrolling strategies.},

Typically, a reward is achieved by visiting a vertex in the graph, and such a reward is constant for all time. This paper considers a variant of OP where the reward of each vertex is an arbitrary time-dependent function, and hence the name time-varying reward OP (TR-OP). To solve this problem, we develop a novel heuristic search algorithm called Reward Maximization A* (RMA*), which is guaranteed to find an optimal solution to TR-OP. We also develop a fast method to compute an admissible heuristic for RMA* that can effectively direct the search to save computational effort. Furthermore, we introduce a hyper-parameter in RMA* that trades off between solution quality and runtime efficiency for RMA*. We benchmark RMA* against a recent dynamic programming (DP) approach, which runs fast in practice, but has no guarantee of the solution optimality. In our tests, RMA* reduces the runtime by up to 70\% compared to DP. By adjusting the hyper-parameter, RMA* is able to find solutions with up to 30\% more rewards than those found by DP.},

The main goal of the patrol routing problem is to maximize the coverage of critical highway stretches while ensuring the feasibility of routes and considering the availability of resources. By investigating the structural properties of the optimal solution, we formulate a new, improved mixed integer program that can solve real life instances to optimality within seconds, where methods proposed in prior literature fail to find a provably optimal solution within an hour. The improved formulation provides enhanced highway coverage for both randomly generated and real life instances. We show an average increase in coverage of nearly 20\% for the randomly generated instances provided in the literature, with a best case increase over 46\%. Similarly, for the real life instances, we close the optimality gap within seconds and demonstrate an additional coverage of over 13\% in the best case. The improved formulation also allows for testing a number of real life scenarios related to multi-start routes, delayed starts at the beginning of the shifts, and taking a planned break during the shift. Being able to solve these scenarios in short durations help decision and policy makers to better evaluate resource allocation options while serving public.},

Prior studies on multi-robot information sharing strategies do not formally address the proof of convergence to the optimal allocation, nor its robustness to dynamic changes in the execution of the global task. The BIS strategy is introduced in a general framework and the convergence to the optimal allocation is theoretically proved. As an illustration of the approach, the strategy is applied to the automatic construction of truss structures with aerial robots. In order to demonstrate the benefits of the strategy, algorithms and simulations are presented for a team of heterogeneous robots that can dynamically reallocate tasks during the execution of a mission.},

  abstract = {A group of cooperative aerial robots can be deployed to efficiently patrol a terrain, in which each robot flies around an assigned area and shares information with the neighbors periodically in order to protect or supervise it. To ensure robustness, previous works on these synchronized systems propose sending a robot to the neighboring area in case it detects a failure. In order to deal with unpredictability and to improve on the efficiency in the deterministic patrolling scheme, this paper proposes random strategies to cover the areas distributed among the agents. First, a theoretical study of the stochastic process is addressed in this paper for two metrics: the idle time, the expected time between two consecutive observations of any point of the terrain and the isolation time, the expected time that a robot is without communication with any other robot. After that, the random strategies are experimentally compared with the deterministic strategy adding another metric: the broadcast time, the expected time elapsed from the moment a robot emits a message until it is received by all the other robots of the team. The simulations show that theoretical results are in good agreement with the simulations and the random strategies outperform the behavior obtained with the deterministic protocol proposed in the literature.},

  abstract = {Hot spot policing involves the deployment of police patrols to places where high levels of crime have previously concentrated. The creation of patrol routes in these hot spots is mainly a manual process that involves using the results from an analysis of spatial patterns of crime to identify the areas and draw the routes that police officers are required to patrol. In this article we introduce a computational approach for automating the creation of hot spot policing patrol routes. The computational techniques we introduce created patrol routes that covered areas of higher levels of crime than an equivalent manual approach for creating hot spot policing patrol routes, and were more efficient in how they covered crime hot spots. Although the evidence on hot spot policing interventions shows they are effective in decreasing crime, the findings from the current research suggest that the impact of these interventions can potentially be greater when using the computational approaches that we introduce for creating hot spot policing patrol routes.},

Designing effective and balanced routes for these applications is challenging, especially when involving multiple postmen from distinct depots. In this research, we formulate this routing problem as a Min-Max Multiple-Depot Rural Postman Problem (MMMDRPP). To solve this routing problem, we develop an efficient tabu-search-based algorithm and propose three novel lower bounds to evaluate the routes. To demonstrate its practical usefulness, we show how to formulate the route design for police patrolling in London as an MMMDRPP and generate balanced routes using the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm is tested on multiple adapted benchmark problems. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the algorithm in generating balanced routes.},

Previous studies have designed different police patrol strategies for routing police patrol, but these strategies have difficulty in generalising to real patrolling and meeting various requirements. In this research we develop a new police patrolling strategy based on Bayesian method and ant colony algorithm. In this strategy, virtual marker (pheromone) is laid to mark the visiting history of each crime hotspot, and patrollers continuously decide which hotspot to patrol next based on pheromone level and other variables.

The routing for multi-AGV, one of the key factors influence the efficiency of AGV systems, remains a challenge if several AGVs travel in a complex environment. In this paper, we develop an efficient routing for multi-AGV by combining centralized control with decentralized control, which is based on the Ant-agent optimized by repulsive potential field (Rf-Ant-agent). The congestion of node in the Ant-agent is optimized by visibility, and a guidance factor is introduced to the path node selection model to determine the travel direction of the AGV in nodes with centralized control. Then, a new repulsive potential field function is proposed, and a scheme of varying velocity is designed to adjust the velocity of AGVs with decentralized control. Furthermore, a new transition rule is established to determine the motion state of AGVs with the combination of centralized control and decentralized control. Finally, Netlogo is used to simulate and analyze the performance of the Rf-Antagent. The simulation results indicate that the perception distance and safe distance influence the efficiency and stability of Rf-Ant-agent, respectively; relative to the Ant-agent, the collision avoidance, transportation distance and transportation efficiency of the Rf-Ant-agent improved by 16.3\%, 4.4\% and 21.8\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {One of the most important tasks faced by police agencies concerns the strategic deployment of patrols in order to respond to calls whilst also deterring crime. Current deployment strategies typically lack robustness as they are often based on tradition. As police agencies are encouraged to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their services, it is essential to devise advanced patrol deployments that are based on recent scientific evidence. Most existing models of patrol deployments are too simplistic, and are thus unable to provide a realistic representation of the complexity of patrol activities. Furthermore, past studies have tended to focus on individual aspects of patrol deployment such as efficiency, reactive effectiveness or proactive effectiveness, rather than consider them all together as part of the same problem. This thesis proposes to develop a decision-support tool for informing better patrol deployment designs. This tool consists of a simulation-based optimisation approach combining two key components: (1) an agent-based model (ABM) of patrol activities used to evaluate the performance of the system under a given deployment configuration and (2) a genetic algorithm (GA) which seeks to speed up the search for optimal deployments. While the developed framework is designed to be applicable to any police force, a case study is provided for the city of Detroit in order to demonstrate its potential. The developed decision-support tool shows considerable potential in informing more cost-effective patrol deployments. First, the ABM of patrol activities allows for exploration of the impact of various deployment decisions that police agencies are unable to experiment with in the real world. Second, the GA makes it possible to optimise patrol deployments by identifying 'good' solutions, which provide faster responses to incidents and deter crime in key areas, in reasonable time.},

However, the planning and deployment of police drones are subject to several challenges, including the proper distance metric for drone flying and the risk-based location optimisation of drone base stations. This study proposes a new framework that enables the optimal deployment of police drones to address crime risk issues on urban street networks. This risk-based decision framework takes into account three potential distance metrics that regulate and shape the flying routes of drones, which in turn affects the optimal location of drone base stations. In addition, this framework takes into account the major risk constraints of flying drones in urban areas, including domestic privacy and elevation. The proposed risk-based decision framework is validated using the real case study of Liverpool with historical crime data and street network layouts. The findings contribute to the operations and management of police drones in urban areas and shift the paradigm of policing drones towards a risk-based regime.},

Decisions are taken dynamically over the decision horizon as situational awareness improves and survival likelihood diminishes with the aim of increasing the expected number of saved lives.

We examine the possibility of the logistics company charging customers selectively with an additional service fee to assure a high level of service. Moreover, we provide managerial insight on when the best time is to pay for the premium membership. We present computational results on commonly studied small to large-scale CVRP instances.

Accordingly, we study the integrated rail-mounted yard crane and AGV scheduling problem as a multi-robot coordination and scheduling problem in this paper. Based on a discretized virtualized network, we propose a multicommodity network flow model with two sets of flow balance constraints for cranes and AGVs. In addition, two side constraints are introduced to deal with inter-robot constraints to reflect the complex interactions among terminal agents accurately. The Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) method is adopted in this study as a market-driven approach to dualize the hard side constraints; therefore, the original problem is decomposed into a set of crane-specific and vehicle-specific subtasks. The cost-effective solutions can be obtained by iteratively adjusting both the primal and dual costs of each subtask. We also compare the computational performance of the proposed solution framework with that of the resource-constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) model using commercial solvers. Comparison results indicate that our proposed approach could efficiently find solutions within 2\% optimality gaps. Illustrative and real-world instances show that the proposed approach effectively serves the accurate coordination of AGVs and cranes in automated terminals.},

  abstract = {The objective of the Patrol Boat Scheduling Problem with Complete Coverage (PBSPCC) is to find a minimum size patrol boat fleet to provide continuous coverage at a set of maritime patrol regions, ensuring that there is at least one vessel on station in each patrol region at any given time. The requirement for continuous patrol coverage is complicated by the need for vessels to be replenished on a regular basis. This combinatorial optimization problem contains both routing and scheduling components and is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we show how recent theoretical insights can be used in conjunction with specially tailored heuristics to accelerate a column generation solution approach over a resource-space-time network construct. We show how the column generation approach can be used within a branch-and-price framework and combined with various reduction techniques to find cyclic and long-term scheduling solutions on a range of test problems.},

In the context of multirobot applications, all robots cooperatively compute a common assignment that optimizes a given global criterion (e.g., the total distance traveled) within a finite set of local computations and communications over a peer-to-peer network. As a motivating application, we consider a class of multirobot routing problems with “spatiotemporal” constraints, i.e., spatial targets that require servicing at particular time instants. As a means of demonstrating the theory developed in this paper, the robots cooperatively find online suboptimal routes by applying an iterative version of the proposed algorithm in a distributed and dynamic setting. As a concrete experimental test bed, we provide an interactive “multirobot orchestral” framework, in which a team of robots cooperatively plays a piece of music on a so-called orchestral floor.},

  abstract = {Route planning in agricultural fields is a major challenge closely related to the amount of inputs consumed and the associated soil compaction. Current approaches primarily focus on reducing the travelled distances (i.e., the trajectories that vehicles have to cover to carry out the task) and generally do not consider other optimization criteria such as input costs (e.g., fuel, herbicides, labor). Furthermore, although few approaches consider more than one vehicle, none of them takes into consideration vehicles with different characteristics, such as different speeds or different turning radii, and some variabilities of the field such as the weed distribution have not been studied yet. All these factors affect the cost of routes to be followed to accomplish agricultural tasks such as site-specific treatments. In this context, this study proposes a very general approach to optimize the routes that considers: (1) different criteria such as the travelled distance, the time required to perform the task and the input costs, even simultaneously, (2) vehicles with different features (e.g., working speeds, both intra and inter-crop, turning radii, fuel consumptions, tank capacities and spraying costs), (3) the variability of the field and (4) the possibility of tank refilling.},

Customers are divided into clusters, each of which is assigned to a single patrol and requires different services, either mandatory or optional, on a weekly basis. The services have to be performed by satisfying several operational constraints, including interdependent time windows and maximum route duration. The aim is to maximize a weighted function that combines the profit collected from the optional services and the total working time required to perform all routes. The resulting optimization problem can be represented as a territory design and multi-period team orienteering problem. We solve the problem using an Iterated Local Search that invokes several inner procedures, including dedicated heuristics for creating the initial clusters, perturbation operators to diversify the search, and a variable neighborhood descent to search for good-quality routes. Extensive computational tests on a set of real-world instances involving up to a few hundred customers and a few thousand services prove the algorithm efficiency.},

  abstract = {We initiate the study of patrolling a unit interval with primitive two-speed, autonomous robots, i.e. robots without memory, no communication capabilities and no computation power. Robots have only two moving-states, one for patrolling and one for walking, each associated with a direction and speed. The robots are moving perpetually, and their moving-states and moving directions change only when they collide. Such a dynamic system induces the so-called idleness for patrolling a unit interval, i.e. the smallest time interval within which every point of the domain is patrolled by some robot. Our main technical contribution is an analytic study of the induced dynamic system of robots, which allows us to decide efficiently whether or not the system converges to a stable configuration that is also shown to be optimal. As a warm-up for our main result, we show how robots can be centrally coordinated, carefully choosing initial locations, so that the induced idleness is optimal. Our main result pertaining to the idleness of primitive robots follows by a technical analysis of their collision locations, which we show, under some conditions, converge to the optimal initial locations for non-distributed robots. Our result finds an application to a transportation problem concerning Scheduling with Regular Delivery. In this optimization problem, an infinite quantity of a commodity, residing at an endpoint of an interval, needs to be transported to the other endpoint. To that end, we show that the already established patrolling schedules of an interval correspond to optimal strategies that guarantee that the flow of the commodity is the largest possible.},

  abstract = {This paper considers the problem of redistricting or redrawing police command boundaries. We model this problem as a constrained graph-partitioning problem involving the partitioning of a police jurisdiction into command districts subject to constraints of contiguity, compactness, convexity and size. Since the districting affects urban emergency services, there also exist quality-of-service constraints, which limit the response time (queue time plus travel time) to calls for service. Confronted with the combinatorial challenge of the districting problem, we propose a simulated annealing algorithm to search for a “good” partitioning of the police jurisdiction. At each iteration of the algorithm, we employ a variant of the well-known PCAM model to optimally assign the patrol cars and assess the “goodness” of a particular district design with respect to some prescribed performance measures. This approach differs from the well-known Hypercube queuing model, which simply evaluates the performance of a user-specified district design and allocation. A computational case study using data from the Buffalo, New York, Police Department reveals the merits of this approach. Scope and purpose Two of the primary concerns of urban police departments are the effective use of patrol cars and the workload balance between officers in different geographical districts. In recent years, a well known, public domain software package based on the Patrol Car Allocation Model (PCAM) has been developed. PCAM was designed to help police management specify the number of patrol cars that should be on duty at various times of the day on each day of the week in each district. For long-term planning, police management also faces the thorny problem of designing these districts. To address this problem, we employ a simulated annealing search method to determine the geographic boundaries between the police districts. PCAM is used to evaluate the “goodness” of each district design encountered in this search, where “goodness” involves minimizing the disparity between the maximum workload and the minimum workload of the police officers. Working with the Buffalo, New York, Police Department, we were able to significantly reduce officer workload disparity while maintaining current levels of response time.},

We develop a general preference-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to converge to preferred solutions. Preferences of a decision maker (DM) are elicited through reference point(s) and the algorithm converges to regions of the Pareto-optimal frontier close to the reference points. The algorithm allows the DM to change his/her reference point(s) whenever he/she so wishes. We devise mechanisms to prevent the algorithm from producing dominated points at the final population.

This study proposes a novel approach to utilize spatial crime data for police patrol route planning. The road network is modeled as an edge-weighted graph, and a custom weight function is used to assign weights to the graph, determining the hotspots. Clustering techniques are then applied to filter hotspots, and an ant colony optimization algorithm is used to plan the routes. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any jurisdiction provided that historical spatial crime data is available. By utilizing the proposed method, law enforcement agencies can enhance their patrolling strategies, resulting in targeted and more efficient approaches to maintaining community safety and security.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a synchronization problem that arises when a team of aerial robots (ARs) need to communicate while performing assigned tasks in a cooperative scenario. Each robot has a limited communication range and flies within a previously assigned closed path. When two robots are close enough, a communication link may be established allowing the robots to share information. The goal is to schedule the flights such that the entire system can be synchronized for maximum information exchange, that is, every pair of neighbors are on the feasible communication link at the same time. We propose an algorithm for scheduling a team of robots in this scenario and propose a robust framework where the synchronization of a large team of robots is assured. The approach allows us to design a fault-tolerant system that can be used for multiple tasks such as surveillance, area exploration, searching for targets in a hazardous environment, and assembly and structure construction, to name a few.},

  abstract = {The problem of partitioning a set of geographically distributed tasks among a team of UAVs that must travel to perform the tasks arises in many contexts, from surveillance to environmental monitoring. When UAVs have limits in their travel distances, it is important to select subsets of tasks for each UAV that achieve highest team values while remaining feasible given limits on UAV resources. This class of problems has been studied previously in computer science and operations research as orienteering problems. This problem is known to be NPHard. Previous algorithms for solving orienteering problems as integer programming problems are slow; faster algorithms have been proposed based on heuristic techniques used in traveling salesperson problems. In this paper, we develop a different class of fast algorithms, based on a decomposition of the orienteering problem into a knapsack assignment problem and a subsequent traveling salesperson problem. We combine greedy algorithms for knapsack problems with the use of spanning trees to estimate traveling salesperson tour lengths to obtain new, approximate algorithms for orienteering problems. We conduct experiments with single and multiple UAV algorithms on benchmark problems as well as problems derived from a LANDAT dataset, comparing our new algorithms with other algorithms in the literature. Our results indicate that our new algorithms are consistently fast, and perform better than competing algorithms.},

It is very important to understand the design process of the HAC system (HACS). Inspired by the systematic analysis framework presented in Part I of this dual publication, this article proposes a normalized twophase procedure, namely, GET-MAN, for the top-level design of HACS from the perspective of system engineering. The two-phase design procedure can produce a coherent and well-running HACS by sophisticatedly and properly determining the six elements of the HACS and their influences. In the verification phase of GETMAN, by applying the formalized HACS framework proposed in Part I, a formal model can be constructed to look ahead (predict) and back (explain) at potential faults in the candidate HACS. An example of the HACS design for target searching is employed to illustrate the use of the GET-MAN design procedure. The potential challenges and future research directions are discussed in the light of the GET-MAN design procedure. The systematic analysis framework, Part I, as well as the GET-MAN design procedure, Part II, can serve as common guidance and reference for analyzing and developing various HACSs.},

In MAMCP-TDR, there are multiple agents to collect linearly decreasing rewards over time. The objective is to maximize total surplus (total reward collected minus total travel cost) by routing multiple agents from a central depot. We propose a mathematical formulation for the problem. Since the problem is strongly NP-hard, we develop a heuristic algorithm, called Cluster-and-Route Algorithm (CRA), to find near-optimal solutions. In CRA, first we cluster the targets/rewards using the well-known k-means clustering algorithm. Then, we find tours by solving a single agent problem for each cluster. To solve the single agent problem, we propose several routing algorithms. Finally, we implement several improvement ideas to improve the final solution. We conduct computational experiments on randomly generated instances and instances of a related problem in the literature to test the performance of routing algorithms for single agent case and the CRA for MAMCP-TDR in terms of solution time and solution quality. Compared to the mathematical formulation, we conclude that CRA provides solutions with similar quality for small instances and performs significantly better both in terms of solution time and solution quality on medium and large instances.},

Each robotic arm has access to specific workstations based on their distance in the cell layout. Therefore, a part may need to be exchanged between several robots according to its process plan. For this purpose, intermediate buffers are positioned between each pair of consecutive robots. Due to the dynamic nature of the problem, new jobs arrive at unpredictable times, which in turn necessitates rescheduling taking the system’s current state into account. To tackle this problem, firstly, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is devised. Secondly, three distinct Speed-up Constraints (SCs) derived from the problem’s inherent characteristics are designed and implemented to accelerate the MILP model’s solving procedure. Afterward, the problem is formulated using Constraint Programming (CP) approach. The performance of the CP model and the MILP model in presence of all possible combinations of the SCs are evaluated and compared through solving various random instances. Next, an analysis is performed on the buffers’ pick-up criterion and how it is affected by the problem’s size. Besides, the impact of changes in the robots’ speed on the productivity of the cell is assessed. Finally, the extent to which the rescheduling priority affects the output of the model is studied.},

Because maritime surveillance resources are extremely expensive, the potential cost savings of using optimization models to do such planning are large. In this paper, we developed a methodology for making maritime surveillance planning more efficient. The purpose of our tool is to find routes for the force elements involved in maritime surveillance operations, where the goal is to keep a maritime picture sufficiently updated. Our problem may be viewed as a variant of the classical periodic vehicle routing problem, but it differs from this problem in some major aspects. To cope with the specific issues of our problem, we introduce a novel time-indexed formulation, where each variable is associated with a set of contiguous time periods. We defined and implemented a branch-and-price procedure to solve this formulation to exact optimality. Moreover, to tackle instances of practical size, we defined and applied efficient and effective heuristic techniques for solving the pricing problem. We show how our approach can plan up to 72-hour realistic missions with routing ships.},

  abstract = {In most Swiss municipalities, a curbside system consisting of heavy trucks stopping at almost each household is used for non-recoverable waste collection. Due to the many stops of the trucks, this strategy causes high fuel consumption, emissions and noise. These effects can be alleviated by reducing the number of stops performed by the collection vehicles. One possibility consists of selecting a subset of candidate locations that are scattered throughout the municipality to place collection points which are used by residents to bring their waste. Provided that the underlying road network is available and that the collection vehicle has a known capacity, we refer to this problem as the capacitated multi-vehicle covering tour problem on a road network (Cm-CTP-R). We propose a road-network-based mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that exploits the sparsity of the network. We compare it against the MILP formulation that results from assuming a customer-based graph, which is typically used in vehicle routing problems (VRP). To solve large instances, we develop a two-phased heuristic approach that addresses the two subproblems the Cm-CTP-R is built on: a set covering problem to select the locations and a split-delivery VRP to determine the tours. Computational experiments on instances derived from real-life data show that the road-network-based formulation is better suited. Furthermore, the proposed heuristic provides good solutions with optimality gaps below 1.7\% and finds better solutions for most of the instances that the exact method is not able to solve within a given time limit.},

We approximate the total attendance to events using a time-varying attraction measure that accounts for the event location and time as well as events nearby in location and time. The influence of events nearby in location and time is known as the performance shadow. The profit calculation accounts for costs associated with travel to locations and holding events. We formulate a mixed-integer programming model that considers several practical constraints. However, the computational complexity of the problem forces us to develop local search and scatter search based heuristic methods to solve larger instances. We compare the performance of the exact formulation and heuristics using test cases based on regional and national tours within the continental U.S and a real life scenario based on U2’s 2017 Joshua Tree tour. A scatter search-based heuristic outperforms all other methods in the experiment. This heuristic is able to find optimal solutions for smaller instances that are solved optimally by a commercial solver. For larger instances, the heuristic outperforms the profit of the best feasible solution returned by the commercial solver by 32.0\%. Finally, for the real life comparison, the scatter search based heuristic improves the profit associated with the CPLEX solution and the actual tour by 52.9\% and 16.5\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {Safe and secure vehicle routing problems refer to the transportation of dangerous (e.g., flammable liquids) or valuable goods (e.g., cash), the surveillance of streets (e.g., police patrols) or other areas (e.g., those within a factory or building), and the response to sudden incidents (e.g., robberies or street disruptions). It thus covers a multitude of models and methods with each having its own objective and constraints, such as unpredictability or risk. We review and classify literature in this field and thereby identify a starting point for researchers in this evolving and practically relevant field. Our study reveals that there are 82 articles that cover aspects related to safe and secure routing, a majority of which were published in the last five years. We classify the articles into five main categories: (i) transportation of hazardous materials, (ii) patrol routing, (iii) cash-in-transit, (iv) dissimilar routing problems, and (v) modeling of multi-graphs. Categories (i)–(iv) elaborate on the problem studied, while (v) provides a general concept based on road network characteristics most commonly found in safe and secure routing problems. Relevant methods and instances, along with their similarities and dissimilarities, have also been discussed in the paper. Furthermore, specific problem characteristics and future research directions are identified.},

  abstract = {Problem definition: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are transforming emergency service logistics applications across sectors, offering easy deployment and rapid response. In the context of emergency medical services (EMS), UAVs have the potential to augment ambulances by leveraging bystander assistance, thereby reducing response times for delivering urgent medical interventions and improving EMS outcomes. Notably, the use of UAVs for opioid overdose cases is particularly promising as it addresses the challenges faced by ambulances in delivering timely medication. This study aims to optimize the integration of UAVs and bystanders into EMS in order to minimize average response times for overdose interventions. Methodology/results: We formulate the joint operation of UAVs with ambulances through a Markov decision process that captures random emergency vehicle travel times and bystander availability. We apply an approximate dynamic programming approach to mitigate the solution challenges from high-dimensional state variables and complex decisions through a neural network-based approximation of the value functions (NN-API). To design the approximation, we construct a set of basis functions based on queueing and geographic properties of the UAV-augmented EMS system. Managerial implications: The simulation results suggest that our NN-API policy tends to outperform several noteworthy rule- and optimization-based benchmark policies in terms of accumulated rewards, particularly for situations that are primarily characterized by high request arrival rates and a limited number of available ambulances and UAVs. The results also demonstrate the benefits of incorporating UAVs into the EMS system and the effectiveness of an intelligent real-time operations strategy in addressing capacity shortages, which are often a problem in rural areas of the United States. Additionally, the results provide insights into specific contributions of each dispatching or redeployment strategy to overall performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Tour planning represents a challenging task for individuals visiting unfamiliar tourist destinations, mainly due to the availability of numerous attractions (points of interest, POIs) and the complexity of metropolitan public transit networks. Several web and mobile tourist city guides already support personalized tour recommendations. However, they exclusively consider walking tours; namely, they fail in motivating tourists to use public transportation for reaching far located important POIs, thereby compromising the perceived overall attractiveness of recommended tours. In this paper, we introduce eCOMPASS, a context-aware web/mobile application which derives personalized multimodal tours via selected urban attractions. eCOMPASS is the only available research or commercial tour planner that assists the way arounds of tourists through public transit. Far beyond than just providing navigational aid, eCOMPASS incorporates multimodality (i.e. time dependency) within its routing logic aiming at deriving near-optimal sequencing of POIs along recommended tours so as to best utilize the time available for sightseeing and minimize waiting time at transit stops. Further advancing the state of the art, eCOMPASS allows users to define arbitrary start/end locations (e.g. the current location of a mobile user) rather than choosing among a fixed set of locations. Last, eCOMPASS may assist in scheduling lunch breaks at affordable restaurants, conveniently located along the recommended tours. The provision of the above mentioned unique features of eCOMPASS is based on modeling and solving a complex optimization problem which takes into account a long list of problem variables and constraints. This paper describes the routing algorithm which comprises the core functionality of eCOMPASS. Further, it discusses the implementation details of the web and mobile eCOMPASS applications using the metropolitan areas of Athens (Greece) and Berlin (Germany) as case studies. Evaluation results report positive user attitude as to the tour planning output with respect to attractiveness, meaningfulness and the overall perceived utility.},

To validate our approach, we conducted extensive computational experiments on instances from literature. The comparison with state-of-the-art methods shows the effectiveness of the proposed method. In particular, seven open instances are closed to optimality for the first time, and the best lower bounds of the six open instances are improved. The exact method for the Multi-vehicle Covering Tour Problem is also embedded in a ϵ-constraint exact method to solve its bi-objective counterpart. Computational results show that the lower bound set provided by this bi-objective exact method is stronger than those provided by the state-of-the-art method from the literature.},

A dynamic variant of the basic optimization model, defined by considering the rolling horizon concept, is shown. We introduce a case study as an application scenario, where sport actions of a football match are filmed through a distributed UAVs system.

While the robots collaboratively and repeatedly cover the regions of interest in the environment, their routes should satisfy two often conflicting properties: i) (efficiency) the time intervals between two consecutive visits to the regions are small; ii) (unpredictability) the patrolling trajectories are random and unpredictable. We manage to strike a balance between the two goals by i) recasting the original patrolling problem as a Graph Deep Learning problem; ii) directly solving this problem on the graph in the framework of cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning. Treating the decisions of a team of agents as a sequence input, our model outputs the agents' actions in order by an autoregressive mechanism. Extensive simulation studies show that our approach has comparable performance with existing algorithms in terms of efficiency and outperforms them in terms of unpredictability. To our knowledge, this is the first work that successfully solves the patrolling problem with reinforcement learning on a graph.},

  abstract = {Traffic congestion has always been an impending challenge for drivers as well as traffic authorities. It causes frustrations to millions of passengers. The estimated financial cost is \$2,200 billion per year in developed countries worldwide. In this paper, we propose an intelligent routing algorithm to minimize the traffic jam occurrence through directing the paths of multiple vehicles cooperatively.

We formulate a capacitated set covering location model to determine the number and feasible locations of vehicle stops. Moreover, we present a multilevel model to optimize the decisions on the remaining processes and finally determine the locations of vehicle stops while minimizing the number of vehicles dispatched and the total travel time.

The problem consists of determining a set of total minimum length vehicle routes on a subset of V, subject to side constraints, such that every vertex of W is within a prespecified distance from a route. Three heuristics are developed for this problem and tested on randomly generated and real data. Scope and purpose In the problem considered in this article, we are given two sets of locations. The first set, V, consists of potential locations at which some vehicles may stop, and the second set, W are locations not actually on vehicle routes, but within an acceptable distance of a vehicle route. The problem is to construct several vehicle routes through a subset of V, all starting and ending at the same locations, subject to some side constraints, having a total minimum length, and such that every location of W is within a reasonable distance of a route. A common application of this problem arises in the delivery of health care facilities by mobile units in developing countries. Here, vehicles travel through a limited number of villages, and every location that is not visited must be within walking distance of a visited location. This article proposes three heuristics capable of solving instances of realistic size within reasonable computing times.},

  abstract = {Motivated by potential efficiency and robustness gains, there is growing interest in the use of multiple robots for coverage. In coverage, robots visit every point in a target area, at least once. Previous investigations of multi-robot coverage focus on completeness of the coverage, and on eliminating redundancy, but do not formally address robustness. Moreover, a common assumption is that elimination of redundancy leads to improved efficiency (coverage time). We address robustness and efficiency in a novel family of multi-robot coverage algorithms, based on spanning-tree coverage of approximate cell decomposition of the work-area. We analytically show that the algorithms are robust, in that as long as a single robot is able to move, the coverage will be completed. We also show that non-redundant (non-backtracking) versions of the algorithms have a worst-case coverage time virtually identical to that of a single robot—thus no performance gain is guaranteed in non-redundant coverage. Surprisingly, however, redundant coverage algorithms lead to guaranteed performance which halves the coverage time even in the worst case. We present a polynomial-time redundant coverage algorithm, whose coverage time is optimal, and which is able to address robots heterogeneous in speed and fuel. We compare the performance of all algorithms empirically and show that the use of the optimal algorithm leads to significant improvements in coverage time.},

  abstract = {In multi-UUV~collaborative attack, a reasonable weapon-target allocation scheme is very important to improve the attack efficiency. The quality and computation time of the solution are the key indices to evaluate the performance of the weapon-target algorithm. At present, the swarm intelligence optimization algorithm represented by genetic algorithm is often used to solve the weapon-target allocation problem, but this method usually adopts the centralized programming solution. Although it can achieve better solution quality, the solution process has disadvantages such as large computation and long time, which limits its application in practice. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a distributed improved non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (DINSGA-II), which includes adaptive crossover and mutation strategies and distributed elite interaction strategies. In addition, we have developed a multi-UUV coordinated attack simulation platform based on XSimStudio using component-based modelling techniques. Finally, the proposed distributed target allocation algorithm is compared with the traditional centralized NSGA-II algorithm on the developed simulation platform. The results show that both algorithms can find a reasonable allocation scheme, but in terms of computational speed, the running time of the DINSGA-II algorithm is about 12 times faster than that of the traditional centralized NSGA-II algorithm with the same problem size.},

In this activity, a fleet of robots visits some places at irregular intervals of time for security purpose. To date, this problem has been solved with different approaches. However, the approaches that obtain the best results are unfeasible for security applications because they are centralized and deterministic. To overcome the disadvantages of previous work, this paper presents a new distributed and non-deterministic approach based on a model from game theory called Smooth Fictitious Play. To this end, the multi-robot patrolling problem is formulated by using concepts of graph theory to represent an environment. In this formulation, several normal-form games are defined at each node of the graph. This approach is validated by comparison with best suited literature approaches by using a patrolling simulator. The results for the proposed approach turn out to be better than previous literature approaches in as many as 88\% of the cases of study. Moreover, the novel approach presented in this work has many advantages over other approaches of the literature such distribution, robustness, scalability, and dynamism. The achievements obtained in this work validate the potential of game theory to protect infrastructures.},

The evaluation metric of the idleness of vertices is considered to evaluate the performance of an algorithm. Minimizing average graph idleness and the graph idleness standard deviation is covered because smaller average idleness means robots visit vertices more often, and smaller standard deviation of the graph idleness means robots visit vertices more regularly. The most effective way to minimize standard deviation is finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a graph. A Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex exactly once, except for the vertex in which it starts and ends, thus visiting it twice. The solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem is known to minimize the cost of the corresponding Hamiltonian cycle. It is an NP-complete problem. If graph size becomes larger the longer time required for finding the minimum cost cycle; however, by partitioning the graph correctly into multiple sections with cooperative robots, the calculation time can be reduced remarkably.},

These companies face uncertain travel times and service times that have to be taken into account when determining the time windows and routes prior to departure. The objective of the proposed robust vehicle routing problem with time window assignments (RVRP-TWA) is to simultaneously determine routes and time window assignments such that the expected travel time and the risk of violating the time windows are minimized. We assume that the travel time probability distributions are not completely known but that some statistics, such as the mean, minimum, and maximum, can be estimated. We extend the robust framework based on the requirements’ violation index, which was originally developed for the case where the specific requirements (time windows) are given as inputs, to the case where they are also part of the decisions. The subproblem of finding the optimal time window assignment for the customers in a given route is shown to be convex, and the subgradients can be derived. The RVRP-TWA is solved by iteratively generating subgradient cuts from the subproblem that are added in a branch-and-cut fashion. Experiments address the performance of the proposed solution approach and examine the trade-off between expected travel time and risk of violating the time windows.},

In this paper, an efficient encoding scheme is developed to tackle both the combination and the permutation of nodes simultaneously, and then we apply an immune based evolutionary approach for solving the BGPRP with the objective of minimizing total routing distance.

This work proposes a distributed event-driven cooperative strategy for multirobot systems to patrol moving objects autonomously. First, forward and backward utility functions are defined as criteria for robots to conduct two-way evaluation when they choose their targets to patrol. Then, three event types and a cooperative action considering energy consumption and visiting frequency comprehensively are proposed to improve coordination among robots during their execution processes. In simulation experiments, the proposed strategy shows significant advantages on decreasing the average and maximum unvisited time of moving objects compared with the state-of-the-art. A marine pollution monitoring case is simulated to demonstrate the practicability of this strategy.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study the role of disruptions in the multi-period vehicle routing problem (VRP), which naturally arises in humanitarian logistics and military applications. We assume that at any time during the delivery phase, each vehicle could have chance to be disrupted. When a disruption happens, vehicles will be unable to continue their journeys and supplies will be unable to be delivered. We model the occurrence of disruption as a given probability and consider the multi-period expected delivery. Our objective is to either minimize the total travel cost or maximize the demand fulfillment, depending on the supply quantity. This problem is denoted as the multi-period vehicle routing problem with disruption (VRPMD). VRPMD does not deal with disruptions in real-time and is more focused on the long-term performance of a single routing plan. We first prove that the proposed VRPMD problems are NP-hard. We then present some analytical properties related to the optimal solutions to these problems. We show that Dror and Trudeau’s property does not apply in our problem setting. Nevertheless, a generalization of Dror and Trudeau’s property holds. Finally, we present efficient heuristic algorithms to solve these problems and show the effectiveness of the proposed models and algorithms through numerical studies.},

This paper investigates HRC mixed-model two-sided assembly line balancing problem, which is a challenging real-world problem in manufacturing systems. The problem is formulated using a mixed-integer programming model with the objectives of minimizing ergonomic risk, energy consumption, and cycle time. To solve the problem efficiently, a multi-objective discrete artificial bee colony algorithm with specialist bees (MDABCSB) is proposed. MDABCSB utilizes a new five-vector encoding and decoding scheme and incorporates two types of neighbor structures for each vector. Additionally, the algorithm introduces specialist bees to search for the optimal solution for each objective, combines a tabu list to help them jump out of local optima, and employs variable neighborhood descent to enhance their exploration capabilities. Furthermore, the algorithm adopts a new temperature-based food sources update mechanism to probabilistically update the food sources of employed bees to reinforce exploitation. By comparing the proposed algorithm with other algorithms, the results demonstrate that MDABCSB performs better in terms of solution performance.},

  abstract = {The process of scheduling an automated guided vehicle (AGV) includes task scheduling, path planning, and traffic control management. The conflict-free scheduling of large-scale multi-load AGVs is a challenging problem in manufacturing logistics and transportation. To solve the problem of scheduling such AGVs in a network logistics system, this study proposes a method of task allocation based on adjacency combination and the shortest path principle. Three priority rules for the mobility of AGVs between nodes are designed, and a transportation strategy that combines single and two-way paths is proposed to reduce computational complexity. By combining with Dijkstra’s method, the authors develop a method to prevent deadlocks and collisions between multiple AGVs based on a timetable of reservations that hierarchically handles conflicts among nodes in multiple stages. Such constraints as AGV congestion or deadlock weaken the effectiveness of the shortest distance rule-based solution. Based on the above, a heuristic search method based on variable neighborhood search is further proposed to optimize the problem of multi-AGV task assignment, and a corresponding theorem is given to avoid the generation of unfeasible solutions by the neighborhood operators and improve the efficiency of the solution. The results of experiments show that the proposed method can adequately solve the problem of scheduling multiple AGVs in a large and dense network.},

These jobs typically have a preventive function, and allow the responders to use their idle time much more productively than in the current standard. When an emergency occurs, the nearest responder must abandon whatever job he or she is doing and go to the emergency. This leads to the optimisation problem of timetabling jobs and moving responders over a discrete network such that the expected emergency response time remains minimal. Our model, the Median Routing Problem, addresses this complex problem by minimising the expected response time to the next emergency and allowing for re-solving after this. We describe a mixed-integer linear program and a number of increasingly refined heuristics for this problem. We created a large set of benchmark instances, both from real-life case study data and from a generator. On the real-life case study instances, the best performing heuristic finds on average a solution only 3.4\% away from optimal in a few seconds. We propose an explanation for the success of this heuristic, with the most pivotal conclusion being the importance of solving the underlying p-Medians Problem.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied extensively to solve complex decision-making problems. In many real-world scenarios, tasks often have several conflicting objectives and may require multiple agents to cooperate, which are the multi-objective multi-agent decision-making problems. However, only few works have been conducted on this intersection. Existing approaches are limited to separate fields and can only handle multiagent decision-making with a single objective, or multi-objective decision-making with a single agent. In this paper, we propose MO-MIX to solve the multi-objective multi-agent reinforcement learning (MOMARL) problem. Our approach is based on the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) framework. A weight vector representing preference over the objectives is fed into the decentralized agent network as a condition for local actionvalue function estimation, while a mixing network with parallel architecture is used to estimate the joint action-value function. In addition, an exploration guide approach is applied to improve the uniformity of the final non-dominated solutions. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively solve the multi-objective multi-agent cooperative decision-making problem and generate an approximation of the Pareto set. Our approach not only significantly outperforms the baseline method in all four kinds of evaluation metrics, but also requires less computational cost.},

Numerical experiments with various parameters are conducted to not only demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model and effectiveness of the solution algorithms, but also to draw managerial insights.

  abstract = {In high-speed railways, unexpected disturbances on maintenance activities may cause serious delays of the scheduled trains and greatly affect the service quality for traveling passengers. In contrast to most existing studies that focused on deterministic maintenance activities, this paper develops a two-stage stochastic programming approach to address the optimization of train schedules under uncertain maintenance plans. Specifically, in the first stage, we aim to determine the departure times of trains from the origin station, since this information needs to be public to passengers in advanced. The objective function is to minimize the expected travel time of trains under uncertain duration time of maintenance activities. In the second stage, given the specific information of maintenance activities, we generate the train schedule by adjusting the stop patterns, train orders and the assignment of tracks at key stations. Due to the computational difficulties arising from the large number of discrete decision variables, we particularly develop a dual decomposition based solution approach to solve the two-stage stochastic model. Our approach decomposes the original problem into a set of scenario-dependent subproblems with much fewer number of variables, which greatly improves the computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct several sets of real-world instances based on the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway corridor to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and solution approach. The results demonstrate that our approach evidently outperforms state-of-art solvers (Gurobi), especially for large-scale instances that Gurobi cannot even return feasible solutions.},

  abstract = {Network-level traffic flow models either assume steady-state urban flows (i.e. accumulationbased models) or track the movement of all vehicles (i.e. trip-based models). The steady-state assumption present in the accumulation-based models may pose a challenge in light of the multi-modal nature of urban flows. It might be indeed a rough assumption for the flow of some transportation modes like buses, cruising-for-parking vehicles, taxis, and on-demand vehicles. Trip-based models address this concern, however, they need significant parameter calibration effort and are not computationally efficient, which substantially reduces the practicality of these models in real-world applications. Nevertheless, despite the critical importance of developing multi-modal traffic flow models, few attempts have been made to investigate these models in network macroscopic fundamental diagram (NMFD)-related literature. This paper bridges this gap by developing a hybrid network-level traffic flow model for mixed bi-modal (i.e. car and bus) networks. The present hybrid model reproduces the dynamics of car flows via accumulation-based model principles while tracking the movement of buses using the trip-based model. This effort also includes the development of a new FIFO-based entrance function to ensure different modes experience the same delay under saturated traffic conditions. Different numerical experiments are conducted to study the hybrid model performance and to compare it with that of accumulation-based and trip-based models in both steady-state and transition periods under different traffic conditions. Our observations reveal that the hybrid model simulates the dynamics of cars and buses by closely following the behavior of its components under free-flow conditions. The model also outperforms the accumulation-based model under saturated traffic conditions while being considerably less demanding than the trip-based model. A further investigation of the model performance is performed for networks with different bus shares in both free-flow and saturated traffic conditions, confirming the results of the initial numerical experiments. The hybrid model’s computational efficiency is demonstrated. The potential real-world applications of the hybrid model in development of bi-modal networklevel simulation models, NMFD-based control strategies along with bus space allocation policies, public transport operation problems, modeling of cruising-for-parking vehicles, taxis, and ondemand vehicles, and modeling and application of autonomous modular vehicles are discussed and future research directions are highlighted.},

We formalize this problem using a graph to represent the environment, enforcing probabilistic survival constraints for each robot, and using a matroid (which generalizes linear independence to sets) to capture the team-based operational constraints. The resulting “Matroid Team Surviving Orienteers” (MTSO) problem has broad applications for robotics such as informative path planning, resource delivery, and search and rescue. We demonstrate that the objective for the MTSO problem has submodular structure, which leads us to develop two polynomial time algorithms which are guaranteed to find a solution with value within a constant factor of the optimum. The second of our algorithms is an extension of the accelerated continuous greedy algorithm, and can be applied to much broader classes of constraints while maintaining bounds on suboptimality. In addition to in-depth analysis, we demonstrate the efficiency of our approaches by applying them to a scenario where a team of robots must gather information while avoiding dangers in the Coral Triangle and characterize scaling and parameter selection using a synthetic dataset.},

To test the performance of the ILS algorithms, computational experiments were done on modified benchmark instances under the cases of linear, convex and concave score decreases, and the results show that the hybrid ILS algorithm improves the others significantly and also gives near optimal solutions for small sized test instances. Finally, a case study was done for a naval warship reconnaissance operation, and the results are reported.},

The goal of the robots is to accomplish complex tasks, captured by local linear temporal logic formulas, and share the collected information with all other robots and possibly also with a user. Specifically, we consider situations where the robot communication capabilities are not sufficient to form reliable and connected networks, while the robots move to accomplish their tasks. In this case, intermittent communication protocols are necessary that allow the robots to temporarily disconnect from the network in order to accomplish their tasks free of communication constraints. We assume that the robots can only communicate with each other when they meet at common locations in space. Our distributed control framework jointly determines local plans that allow all robots to fulfill their assigned temporal tasks, sequences of communication events that guarantee information exchange infinitely often, and optimal communication locations that minimize a desired distance metric. Simulation results verify the efficacy of the proposed controllers.},

The objective is to find the locations to deploy UASs and assign Unmanned Aerial Vehicles to regions for surveillance. One of the objectives is to maximize search effectiveness, while the second is the minimization of the threats posed to the UASs. These two objectives are in conflict, because they are affected differently by the proximity between the UAS locations and the target regions. First, we have formulated this problem as a mixed integer nonlinear program. Next, we have developed its linearization which can be solved by a commercial optimizer for small-scale problem instances. To solve large-scale problems, we have adopted a well-known metaheuristic for multi-objective problems, namely the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm. We have also developed a hybrid approach, which has proven to be more effective than each approach alone.},

  abstract = {We consider a logistics service provider which arranges transportation services to customers with different service agreements. The most prominent feature of this service agreement is the time period in which these customers send their orders and want to retrieve delivery information. After customers place their orders, they require information about the driver and an early indication of the arrival times. At the moment, this information needs to be provided. The order information of other customers with a different service agreement that needs to be serviced in the same period might still be unknown. Ultimately all customers have to be planned, constrained by the information provided to the customers in the earlier stage. In this paper, we investigate how the logistic service provider plans its routes and communicates the driver and arrival time information in the phase where not all customers are known (stage 1). Once all customer orders are known (stage 2), the final routes can be determined, which adhere to the already communicated driver and arrival time information from stage 1, minimizing total routing cost. For this problem, an exact algorithm is presented. This problem is solved using a novel tractable branch-and-bound method and re-optimization in stage 2. Detailed results are presented, showing the improvements of using re-optimization. We show that integrating the planning of the customers with the different service agreements leads to significant cost savings compared to treating the customers separately (as is currently done by most logistics service providers).},

However, the Non-Priority locations are often neglected during the task. It is necessary to balance the patrols on both kinds of sites to avoid breaches in security. We present a distributed online algorithm that assigns the routes to agents that ensures a finite time visit to the Non-Priority locations along with Priority Patrolling. The proposed algorithm generates offline patrol routes (Rabbit Walks) with three segments (Hops) to explore non-priority locations. The generated number of offline walks depends exponentially on a parameter introduced in the proposed algorithm, thereby facilitating the scalable implementation based on the onboard resources available on each patrolling robot. A systematic performance evaluation through simulations and experimental results validates the proportionately balanced visits and suggests the proposed algorithm's versatile applicability in the implementation of deterministic and non-deterministic scenarios.},

It uses a new operator, called mimic operator, to generate a new solution by imitating an incumbent solution. Furthermore, to improve the quality of a solution, it employs an operator, called swallow operator which attempts to swallow (or insert) an infeasible node and then repair the resulting infeasible solution. A comparative study supports the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, especially, our algorithm can quickly find new better results for several large-scale instances.

The robots have limited communication capabilities and, therefore, communicate their measurements intermittently only when they are physically close to each other. To decrease the distance that the robots need to travel only to communicate, we divide them into small teams that can communicate at different locations to share information and update their beliefs. Then, we propose a new distributed scheme that combines: first, communication schedules that ensure that the network is intermittently connected, and second, sampling-based motion planning for the robots in every team with the objective to collect optimal measurements and decide a location for those robots to communicate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DSE framework that relaxes all network connectivity assumptions, and controls intermittent communication events so that the estimation uncertainty is minimized. We present simulation results that demonstrate significant improvement in estimation accuracy compared to methods that maintain an end-to-end connected network for all time.},

  abstract = {With the rising urbanization and booming e-commerce, traditional last-mile delivery systems fail to satisfy the need for faster, cheaper, and more environmentally friendly deliveries. Several new approaches are put forward as an alternative to classical delivery systems in this regard, yet none of them offers the same level of flexibility, capacity, reliability, and managerial control by itself. This paper proposes a new last-mile delivery model that combines several new approaches and technologies to address this issue. More precisely, we suggest using public transit as a backbone network completed by automated service points, crowd-shipping, and backup transfers with zero-emission vehicles to provide a low-cost and environmentally friendly express delivery service. The design problem for the envisioned system is formulated as a two-stage stochastic program, and a branch-and-price (BP) algorithm is devised to solve it. Taking advantage of the nearly decomposable structure that would emerge in possible real-world applications, our study presents the first example of using decomposition branching in a BP framework to enhance computational efficiency. Extensive computational studies and simulations with real-world data reveal valuable managerial insights for the proposed system and attest to the efficacy of the suggested methodology.

  abstract = {Nowadays, the complexity of the global supply chain is increasing. Thus, the vehicle routing problem (VRP) has become a very important problem because of its practicality in real-world applications. In addition, most customers prefer to have their goods delivered in a specific time interval, and sustainability has become a very important issue for most companies. Therefore, this study proposes a mathematical model for a multi-objective VRP with time windows (VRPTW) as well as an algorithm to solve it. The model consists of two objectives: minimizing the total supply chain cost, and carbon emission. Besides the objectives, the proposed model and algorithm also consider the disruption that commonly happens in the supply chain. This study designs a two-stage VRPTW to solve the disruption. The first stage is the supply chain in ideal condition, while the second one is the supply chain in disrupted condition since the increase in the supply chain complexity also leads to more vulnerability to disruptions. This study improves a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm (MOPSO) to solve the problem. As fitness cannot decide which algorithm is better, this study uses quality indicators to compare all of the algorithms. Based on the computational result, the improved MOPSO has the highest hypervolume and lowest spacing. Thus, it can be concluded that the improved MOPSO is the best algorithm to solve disruption in the two-stage VRPTW.},

  abstract = {As literature around policing and society grows, there is increased use of, and focus upon the concept of police ‘demand’. The concept itself, however, is ill-defined and no consensus exists about how it should be measured. This paper addresses these issues by undertaking a scoping review of literature on the topic, and by exploring how demand has been conceptualised in both academic and practitioner communities. The review reveals that while key interdependencies between police demand and supply are widely discussed, they are often analysed in isolation. To add to the academic discussion of police demand, the paper introduces a comprehensive conceptualisation including the various forms police demand can take and the different manifestations of drivers for police demand. Subsequently, it outlines several approaches that might be levied to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of demand management approaches. These include the consideration of trade-offs that need to be considered. For example, there is a need to balance any resources allocated to deal with proactive demand reduction and that necessary for (reactive) response. Considering the dynamics of police demand and – by necessity – supply through the lens of complex adaptive systems we propose potential ways forward that capitalise on this framing.},

  abstract = {Disaster response operations typically involve multiple decision-makers, and each decision-maker needs to make its decisions given only incomplete information on the current situation. To account for these characteristics – decision making by multiple decision-makers with partial observations to achieve a shared objective –, we formulate the decision problem as a decentralized-partially observable Markov decision process (dec-POMDP) model. To tackle a well-known difficulty of optimally solving a dec-POMDP model, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been used as a solution technique. However, typical MARL algorithms are not always effective to solve dec-POMDP models. Motivated by evidence in single-agent RL cases, we propose a MARL algorithm augmented by pretraining. Specifically, we use behavioral cloning (BC) as a means to pretrain a neural network. We verify the effectiveness of the proposed method by solving a dec-POMDP model for a decentralized selective patient admission problem. Experimental results of three disaster scenarios show that the proposed method is a viable solution approach to solving dec-POMDP problems and that augmenting MARL with BC for its pretraining seems to offer advantages over plain MARL in terms of solution quality and computation time.},

We consider/assume the goal of multiple vehicles is to travel to maximize the sum of collected profits under resource (e.g., time, fuel) consumption constraints. Such re-planning problems occur in a wide range of intelligent UAS applications where changes in the mission environment force the operation of multiple vehicles to change from the original plan. To solve this problem with deep reinforcement learning (RL), we develop a policy network with self-attention on each partial tour and encoder-decoder attention between the partial tour and the remaining nodes. We propose a modified REINFORCE algorithm where the greedy rollout baseline is replaced by a local mini-batch baseline based on multiple, possibly non-duplicate sample rollouts. By drawing multiple samples per training instance, we can learn faster and obtain a stable policy gradient estimator with significantly fewer instances. The proposed training algorithm outperforms the conventional greedy rollout baseline, even when combined with the maximum entropy objective. The efficiency of our method is further demonstrated in two classical problems – the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The experimental results show that our method enables models to develop more effective heuristics and performs competitively with the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning methods.},

  abstract = {Police forces are constantly competing to provide adequate service whilst faced with major funding cuts. The funding cuts result in limited resources hence methods of improving resource efficiency are vital to public safety. One area where improving the efficiency could drastically improve service is the planning of patrol routes for incident response officers. Current methods of patrolling lack direction and do not consider response demand. Police patrols have the potential to deter crime when directed to the right areas. Patrols also have the ability to position officers with access to high demand areas by pre-empting where response demand will arise. The algorithm developed in this work directs patrol routes in real-time by targeting high crime areas whilst maximising demand coverage. Methods used include kernel density estimation for hotspot identification and maximum coverage location problems for positioning. These methods result in more effective daily patrolling which reduces response times and accurately targets problem areas. Though applied in this instance to daily patrol operations, the methodology could help to reduce the need for disaster relief operations whilst also positioning proactively to allow quick response when disaster relief operations are required.},

Using multi-scenario dwell times to capture its uncertainty, in this study, a two-stage chance-constrained stochastic model involving a section-time allocation stage and an optimal driving strategy stage is developed to minimize the expected energy consumption and improve stability. An exact nested dynamic programming (NDP) framework was designed to solve the model. The effectiveness and performance of the proposed methodology were investigated using a series of numerical experiments based on a small-scale instance from the Beijing Yizhuang Line. The optimized section-time allocation strategy reduced the expected energy consumption by 6.6\% and improved the the minimum stability ratio by 8.5\% by selecting the appropriate weight ratio. Four other sensitivity analyses were conducted to provide realistic managerial insights. Finally, a large-scale study of the Beijing 4-Daxing Subway Line was conducted to validate the scalability and efficiency of the NDP framework.},

In the ASVRP, there is a set of fish farms located in the sea, where each fish farm has one or more service tasks to be performed by a given heterogeneous fleet of service vessels with different capabilities. Some service tasks require simultaneous operation of more than one vessel and might also have time windows and precedence requirements. Furthermore, varying weather conditions make the sailing times and the service times of the tasks time dependent. The objective of the ASVRP is to maximize the value of the service tasks performed within a given planning horizon. We propose a time discrete optimization model for the ASVRP, formulated as a time dependent, prize collecting vehicle routing problem with synchronization constraints and time windows. Furthermore, we present an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) heuristic for solving the problem. Results on a number of test instances based on real world data show that both the ALNS heuristic and a commercial solver are able to find high quality solutions for small problem instances, while the ALNS heuristic is superior when the problem size increases.},

Specifically, a number of state troopers start their routes at temporary stations (TS), patrol critical locations with high crash frequencies, and end their shifts at other (or the same) TS so the starting points for the next period are also optimized. We determine the number of state troopers, their assigned routes, and the locations of the TS where they start and end their routes. The TS are selected from a given set of potential locations. The problem, therefore, is a multi-period dynamic location-routing problem in the context of public service. Our objective is to maximize the critical location coverage benefit while minimizing the costs of TS selections, vehicle utilizations, and routing/travel. The multi-objective nature of the problem is handled using an ɛ-constraint approach. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear programming model and solve it using both off-the-shelf optimization software and a custom-built, efficient heuristic algorithm. The heuristic, utilizing the hierarchical structure of the problem, is built on the decomposition of location and routing problems. By allowing routing to start from multiple locations, our model improves the coverage by as much as 12\% compared with the single-depot coverage model.},

Logistics companies, therefore, must implement innovative technologies or services in their logistics processes. It is critical to adopt unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in last mile delivery and urban logistics. The service provider applies the characteristics of UAVs to complete more requests, benefiting more revenue. However, it may not be a satisfactory solution, because the customers will be dissatisfied if the actual delivery time does not align with their expectations. This study constructs a revenue maximization model subject to time windows and customer satisfaction. Instead of addressing the traveling salesmen problem, this model takes new customer requests during the delivery process into account. We solved the problem using a genetic algorithm. The results show: (1) the model found an approximate and effective solution in the real-time delivery environment; (2) customer satisfaction is inversely proportional to the total delivery distance; (3) regarding the result of the sensitivity analysis of this study, investment in UAV has no influence on total profit and customer satisfaction. Moreover, the customer is a key factor in the logistics decision-making platform, not the provider’s investment in UAVs.},

To design a patrol policy, the patroller needs to take into account not only the graph structure, but also the different attack time distributions, as well as different costs incurred due to successful attacks, at different nodes. We consider both random attackers and strategic attackers. A random attacker chooses which node to attack according to a probability distribution known to the patroller. A strategic attacker plays a two-person zero-sum game with the patroller. For each case, we give an exact linear program to compute the optimal solution. Because the linear programs quickly become computationally intractable as the problem size grows, we develop index-based heuristics. In the random-attacker case, our heuristic is optimal when there are two nodes, and in a suitably chosen asymptotic regime. In the strategic-attacker case, our heuristic is optimal when there are two nodes if the attack times are deterministic taking integer values. In our numerical experiments, our heuristic typically achieves within 1\% of optimality with computation time orders of magnitude less than what is required to compute the optimal policy.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces and studies real-time vehicle rerouting problems with time windows, applicable to delivery and/or pickup services that undergo service disruptions due to vehicle breakdowns. In such problems, one or more vehicles need to be rerouted, in real-time, to perform uninitiated services, with the objective to minimize a weighted sum of operating, service cancellation and route disruption costs. A Lagrangian relaxation based-heuristic is developed, which includes an insertion based-algorithm to obtain a feasible solution for the primal problem. A dynamic programming based algorithm solves heuristically the shortest path problems with resource constraints that result from the Lagrangian relaxation. Computational experiments show that the developed Lagrangian heuristic performs very well.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot task allocation means to distribute and schedule a set of tasks to be accomplished by a group of robots to minimize cost while satisfying operational constraints. It can be challenging to solve a large number of tasks and becomes even more challenging when tightly coupled multi-robot tasks are also taken into account. For example, it is more complex to solve problems that include tasks that have to be carried out jointly by two robots due to the resulting temporal and spatial constraints. Additionally, the complexity of task allocation increases exponentially with rising task variety. This paper focuses on multi-robot task allocation in inspection problems with both single- and two-robot tasks. A novel memetic algorithm is proposed combining a genetic algorithm with two local search schemes. Using permutation representation, eight approaches based on four basic coding strategies are designed for multi-robot task allocation of inspection problems with two-robot tasks. The performance of the memetic algorithm is evaluated in case studies on inspecting a large storage tank area of a petroleum refinery.},

However, in multi-robot collaboration, the periodicity of patrol paths can easily lead to leakage of patrol patterns. Therefore, it is particularly important to increase the randomness of robot patrol paths. To solve this problem, this study establishes a multi-robot path planning model based on the access period using the node mode frequency as an indicator to ensure the privacy and security of the path information during the patrol process. Through multiple simulations on the real road network, a highly secure multi-robot patrol path was successfully obtained. Compared with the genetic algorithm, the sparrow search algorithm is shown to have faster search speed and solution efficiency.},

  abstract = {In the e-commerce era, efficient order fulfillment processes in distribution centers have become a key success factor. One novel technology to streamline these processes is robot-assisted order picking. In these systems, human order pickers are supported by autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), which carry bins for collecting picking orders, autonomously move through the warehouse, and wait in front of a shelf containing a requested stock keeping unit (SKU). Once a picker has approached a waiting AMR and placed the requested SKU into the respective bin, AMR and picker may separate and move toward other picking positions. In this way, pickers continuously move between different waiting AMRs without having to return to the depot. This paper treats the coordination of multiple AMRs and multiple pickers to minimize the makespan. We present a heuristic method for the deterministic case that can handle the requirements of large e-commerce fulfillment centers and successfully solves instances with more than one thousand picking positions. Based on the obtained solutions, the performance of our picking system is compared with the traditional warehouse setup without AMR support and to another work policy using fixed pairings of picker and AMR per order. We find that largely improved makespans can be expected. In addition, we analyze the effects of stochastic picking times, speed differences between AMRs and pickers, and a zoning strategy. The ripple effect caused by stochastic picking times, in which a single delay may cascade through a tightly synchronized schedule and deteriorate picking performance, can be effectively mitigated by separating the workforce into smaller subgroups. Another important finding is that pickers and AMR should have approximately the same travel speed because slower AMRs deteriorate system performance. Finally, zoning slightly decreases the flexibility of the system and should be used if dictated by organizational reasons.

  abstract = {When designing a patrol route, it is often necessary to pay more attention to locations with high crime rates. In this paper, we study a patrol routing problem for a fleet of patrol cars patrolling a region with a high-crime neighborhood (HCN) consisting of multiple hot spots. Considering the disorder and chaos in the HCN, at least one patrol car is required in the HCN at any given time during the patrol. We call this routing problem the hot spot coverage patrol problem (HSCPP). In the HSCPP, the importance of a patrol location is quantified by a prize, and the prize is collected if a patrol car visits the location. Our objective is to maximize the sum of prizes collected by the patrol cars, obeying all operational requirements. We propose mathematical formulations and develop several solution approaches for the HSCPP. The global approach consists of finding the routing solution for all patrol cars with a single integer programming (IP) formulation. The partition approach involves first partitioning the region geographically and solving the routing problem in each subregion with two IP formulations. Next, we strengthen the partition approach by developing a column generation (CG) approach in which the initial columns of the CG approach are the solutions generated from the partition approach. We conduct a detailed computational case study using instances based on real crime data from Montgomery County, Maryland. To further understand the computational tractability of our solution approaches, we also perform a sensitivity analysis using synthetic instances under various scenarios.

In this study, we first introduce each UAV’s kinematic constraint and extend the Euclidean distance between fields to the Dubins path distance. We then analyze the two factors affecting the pesticide spraying effects, which are the type of pesticides and the temperature during the pesticide spraying. The time window of the pesticide spraying is dynamically generated according to the temperature and is introduced to the pesticide spraying efficacy function. Finally, according to the extensions, we propose a team orienteering problem with variable time windows and variable profits model. We propose the genetic algorithm to solve the above model and give the methods of encoding, crossover, and mutation in the algorithm. The experimental results show that this model and its solution method have clear advantages over the common manual allocation strategy and can provide the same results as those of the enumeration method in small-scale scenarios. In addition, the results also show that the algorithm parameter can affect the solution, and we provide the optimal parameters configuration for the algorithm.},

In contrast to the classical two-echelon routing problem, the UAV has to launch and land on the GV frequently to change or charge its battery while the GV is moving on the road network. A new 0–1 integer programming model is developed to formulate the problem, where the constraints on the spatial and temporal cooperation of GV and UAV routes are included. Two heuristics are proposed to solve the model: the first heuristic (H1) constructs a complete tour for all targets and splits it by GV routes, while the second heuristic (H2) constructs the GV tour and assigns UAV flights to it. Random instances with six different sizes (25–200 targets, 12–80 rendezvous nodes) are used to test the algorithms. Computational results show that H1 performs slightly better than H2, while H2 uses less time and is more stable.},

We propose an efficient heuristic to provide solutions in almost real-time. The heuristic progressively constructs new routes for each active vehicle, which may load additional product by visiting the warehouse or the immobilized vehicle. If appropriate, we solve this replenishment sub-problem by a fast labelling algorithm. We test the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic by comparing its solutions with those obtained by an appropriate Genetic Algorithm (GA) that yields high quality (but computationally expensive) results.},

  abstract = {The rising competition in the logistics sector forces companies to be more economically efficient. One of the major sources of inefficiency is the incomplete usage of available resources, such as vehicles’ capacities. Mechanism that allow to better exploit such resources by enabling carrier collaborations are on the rise. Our study examines a centrally organized multi-period collaborative vehicle routing problem, where carriers can exchange customers who have to be serviced on a regular basis. Collaborations, where carriers serve frequent customers, are supposed to face the problem of (i) time consistency in terms of visiting time, and of (ii) service consistency. The latter ensures that customers are visited by the same collaboration partner throughout the whole planning horizon. Additionally, carriers might only be willing to enter a collaboration if a minimum market share can be guaranteed. In order to take all these issues into account, we introduce the collaborative vehicle routing problem with time and service consistency and workload balance. The mathematical model including several valid inequalities is presented. In a computational study, we solve small-sized instances to optimality. In order to tackle larger instances, we propose an efficient and effective matheuristic and an iterated local search algorithm. We show that both methods reach near optimal solutions within very short computational times. Managerial insights on the cost of imposing time and service consistency as well as workload balancing constraints are presented and discussed. We show that, according to our computational study, consistency constraints can be imposed for almost no additional cost, while workload balancing constraints do not have any negative effect on the total collaboration profit. This is a meaningful insight and might be a strong argument for carriers to enter collaborations.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of electric vehicles in road and air transportation, especially in last-mile delivery and city mobility, raises new operational challenges due to the limited capacity of electric batteries. These limitations impose additional driving range constraints when optimizing the distribution and mobility plans. During the last years, several researchers from the Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Operations Research communities have been developing optimization, simulation, and machine learning approaches that aim at generating efficient and sustainable routing plans for hybrid fleets, including both electric and internal combustion engine vehicles. After contextualizing the relevance of electric vehicles in promoting sustainable transportation practices, this paper reviews the existing work in the field of electric vehicle routing problems. In particular, we focus on articles related to the well-known vehicle routing, arc routing, and team orienteering problems. The review is followed by numerical examples that illustrate the gains that can be obtained by employing optimization methods in the aforementioned field. Finally, several research opportunities are highlighted.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a multirobot scheduling problem in which autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must be recharged during a long-term mission. The proposal is to introduce a separate team of dedicated charging robots that the UAVs can dock with in order to recharge. The goal is to schedule and plan minimum cost paths for charging robots such that they rendezvous with and replenish the UAVs, as needed, during the mission. The approach is to discretize the 3-D UAV flight trajectories into sets of projected charging points on the ground, thus allowing the problem to be abstracted onto a partitioned graph. Solutions consist of charging robot paths that collectively charge each of the UAVs. The problem is solved by first formulating the rendezvous planning problem to recharge each UAV once using both an integer linear program and a transformation to the Travelling Salesman Problem. The methods are then leveraged to plan recurring rendezvous’ over longer horizons using fixed horizon and receding horizon strategies. Simulation results using realistic vehicle and battery models demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Over the past two decades, equity aspects have been considered in a growing number of models and methods for vehicle routing problems (VRPs). Equity concerns most often relate to fairly allocating workloads and to balancing the utilization of resources, and many practical applications have been reported in the literature. However, there has been only limited discussion about how workload equity should be modeled in the context of VRPs, and various measures for optimizing such objectives have been proposed and implemented without a critical evaluation of their respective merits and consequences. This article addresses this gap by providing an analysis of classical and alternative equity functions for biobjective VRP models. In our survey, we review and categorize the existing literature on equitable VRPs. In the analysis, we identify a set of axiomatic properties that an ideal equity measure should satisfy, collect six common measures of equity, and point out important connections between their properties and the properties of the resulting Pareto-optimal solutions. To gauge the extent of these implications, we also conduct a numerical study on small biobjective VRP instances solvable to optimality. Our study reveals two undesirable consequences when optimizing equity with nonmonotonic functions: Pareto-optimal solutions can consist of non-TSP-optimal tours, and even if all tours are TSP optimal, Pareto-optimal solutions can be workload inconsistent, i.e., composed of tours whose workloads are all equal to or longer than those of other Pareto-optimal solutions. We show that the extent of these phenomena should not be underestimated. The results of our biobjective analysis remain valid also for weighted sum, constraint-based, or single-objective models. Based on this analysis, we conclude that monotonic equity functions are more appropriate for certain types of VRP models, and suggest promising avenues for further research on equity in logistics.

Time-dependent travel time and multiple preferences are two of the most important factors in practice, and have been handled separately in previous work. However, no attempts have been made so far to consider these two factors together. Handling both multiple preferences and time-dependent travel time simultaneously poses a challenging optimization task in this NP-hard problem. In this study, two meta-heuristic methods are proposed for solving MOTDOP: a Multi-Objective Memetic Algorithm (MOMA) and a Multi-objective Ant Colony System (MACS). Two sets of benchmark instances were generated to evaluate the proposed algorithms. The experimental studies show that both MOMA and MACS managed to find better solutions than an existing multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (FMOEA). Additionally, MOMA achieved better performance than MACS in a shorter time, and is less sensitive to the parameter setting. Given that MACS inherits promising features of P-ACO, which is a state-of-the-art algorithm for multi-objective orienteering problem, the advantage of MOMA over MACS and FMOEA demonstrates the efficacy of adopting the memetic algorithm framework to solve MOTDOP.},

In the world, the renewal of EVs has become a general trend. Therefore, the concern about EVs is a hot issue at present, but EVs have the characteristics of limited driving distance and long charging time. When the EVs are used in logistics transportation, these characteristics have a significant impact on the vehicle routing problems. Therefore, based on the research experience of traditional vehicle routing optimization, combining with the characteristics of EVs, this paper presents an optimal problem of electric vehicle routes with time windows based on two charging methods and it also designs a mathematical model which was caused by early and late arrival as the objective function to minimize the transportation cost, vehicle use cost, power supply cost, and penalty cost. The model is solved using an ant colony algorithm. Finally, the ant colony algorithm is tested and analysed with an example.},

The problem requires an effective solution in almost real time. We propose a new heuristic to provide efficient solutions within this strict computational time constraint. To test the quality of the heuristic, we have developed and validated a Genetic Algorithm (GA) that obtains high quality (but computationally expensive) solutions.

For this reason, we refine patrol optimization to focus on the critical ridges in hot spots.

We create multi-run confidence intervals and show that our patrol templates cover around 94\% of incidents for 0.1-mile envelopes around ridges, and deliver evidence that ridges following crime densities enhances the efficiency of patrols.

  abstract = {Multirobot coordination for finding multiple users in an environment can be used in numerous robotic applications, including search and rescue, surveillance/monitoring, and activities of daily living assistance. Existing approaches have limited coordination between robots when generating team plans or do not consider user location probability within these plans. This results in long searches and robots potentially revisiting the same locations in succession. In this article, we present a novel multirobot person search system to generate search plans for multirobot teams to find multiple dynamic users before a deadline. Our approach is unique in that it simultaneously considers the search actions of all robots and user location probabilities when generating team plans, where user location probabilities are represented as conditional spatial-temporal probability density functions. We model this multirobot person search problem as a two-stage optimization problem to maximize the expected number of users found before the deadline. Stage 1 solves the action selection problem to determine a set of team actions, and the second stage solves the action allocation problem to distribute these actions amongst the robots. Namely, in stage 1, a novel conditional multiperiod multiknapsack problem is modeled as a min-flow graph solved sequentially by the Bellman–Ford shortest path algorithm. Stage 2 is a variant of the min-max multitraveling salesperson problem which models the environment topology as a search region network and search times selected by the previous stage. This stage is solved by a novel fuzzy clustering method. Numerous experiments comparing our proposed method to other existing approaches with varying environment sizes, search durations, and the number of users showed that our approach was able to find more target users before a defined deadline.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing problem with drones (VRPD) is an extension of classical vehicle routing, which involves the usage of trucks and drones. Nowadays, bushfires are taken into account as a major global challenging subject. Indeed, forests are very vulnerable to fires, and the classical patrol systems cannot patrol all areas of the forest and pastures due to the difficult crossing of some routes. The literature survey demonstrated that the mathematical models are an efficient approach for planning forest and rangeland patrols. Drones and trucks are used in cooperation for forest monitoring in this study, with drones acting as an efficient and accurate means of monitoring routes that are impassable to ground vehicles. However, this novel approach deals with several substantial challenges, including limitation in the drone's battery and the routing problem in an integrated truck-drone system based on considering hard-to-reach areas and creating a trade-off between time and cost of the patrol process. These issues make significant differences between the proposed novel approach and the classical vehicle routing problem. Thus, it is essential to develop a comprehensive approach to resolve these crucial issues. The present study develops a multi-objective mathematical programming model as mixed-integer programming for simultaneous patrolling of trucks and drones. The augmented epsilon constraint (AEC) method has been considered to solve the two-objective mathematical programming model. Besides, Benders' decomposition (BD) algorithm has been employed to evaluate the achieved results in large-size problems. The performance of the BD algorithm has been confirmed in this study. The findings indicated that the proposed model efficiently protected the forest via monitoring all areas, including impassable areas where ground patrolling is impossible (e.g., the lack of roads due to dense vegetation). Also, it was proved that this system was a novel, cost-effective patrol, which prevents uncontrollable fires in the shortest possible time.},

Specifically, we focus on a routing problem using multi-stop ADVs, with the goal of minimizing route and vehicle usage costs while satisfying several constraints associated with load and battery capacities, maximum route duration for ADVs, and maximum walking distance for customers. We refer to this problem as the Autonomous Delivery Vehicle Routing Problem (ADVRP) and present its mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we propose a two-phase metaheuristic approach that first clusters customers and determines stopping locations for the ADVs, followed by a phase that determines the optimal routes for the ADVs using hybrid variable neighborhood search and simulated annealing. To evaluate our proposed solution methodology, we conduct computational experiments on various related Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) from the literature and newly generated ADVRP instances. The results show that the proposed two-phase metaheuristic approach can produce high-quality solutions with minimal computational effort while outperforming an exact solver in 26 medium- and large-sized instances of ADVRP and reaching optimal solutions in most VRP instances and related problems. Furthermore, we conduct sensitivity analyses on selected problem parameters and present a case study in Istanbul, Turkey to provide managerial insights for implementing ADVs in urban logistics.},

For these purposes, the minimax regret criteria is applied to a set of pre-established instances from the literature, adding the necessary information requirements to evaluate how the method behaves through different parameter combinations, thus changing the number of nodes, costs, and available alternatives and scenarios. The study compares the solutions achieved against the solutions from the classical model to assess the relation between the results from the exercise and the different parameter modifications implemented, achieving a 40\% improvement in the total cost algorithm—proportional to the increase in the alternatives and scenarios assessed. The approach proposed allows us to create disruption scenarios for the distribution process, which are connected to the mathematical optimization problem that allows us to determine the best routing process given the uncertainty associated with the disruption events. Our results also allow us to analyze the trades off between the green factors when they are included in the objective function and the results without them.},

  abstract = {We extend the classical problem setting of the orienteering problem (OP) to incorporate multiple drones that cooperate with a truck to visit a subset of the input nodes. We call this problem the OP with multiple drones (OP-mD). Drones have a limited battery endurance, and thus, they can either move together with the truck at no energy cost for the battery or be launched by the truck onto short flights that must start and end at different customer locations. A drone serves exactly one customer per flight. Moreover, the truck and the drones must wait for each other at the landing locations. A customer prize can be collected at most once, either upon visiting it by the truck or upon serving it by a drone. Similarly to the OP, we maximize the total collected prize under the condition that the truck and the drones return to the depot within a given amount of time. We provide a mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the OP-mD and devise a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm based on a novel decomposition of the problem. We solve instances of the OP-mD with up to 50 nodes within one hour of CPU time with a standard computational setup. Finally, we adapt our framework to solve closely related problems in the literature and compare the resulting computational performance with that of previous studies.},

  abstract = {We study the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) route planning problem for information collection missions performed in terrains with stochastic attributes. Uncertainty is associated with the availability of information, the effectiveness of the search and collection sensors the UAV carries, and the flight time required to travel between target regions in the mission terrain. Additionally, uncertainties in flight duration vary the detection threat exposed in missions performed in nonfriendly terrains. We develop a mixed integer programming model to maximize the expected information collection while limiting the risks of not completing the mission on time and of being detected and restricting the variance imposed on flight duration. The model allows multiple path alternatives between target pairs and revisits to the same target regions. Computational experiments are performed on randomly generated instances to investigate the impact of problem parameters and mission restrictions. We also develop a case study with a military and a civilian application, each of which with different specifications. In addition, we validate that the actual performance of the optimal solution of the model is close to the result reported by the solver via a simulation study. We conclude that the developed model is robust and can be used for practical-sized missions, and the failure rate of its optimal routes in actual missions is negligibly small.},

  abstract = {Optimal task allocation among the suitably formed robot groups is one of the key issues to be investigated for the smooth operations of multi-robot systems. Considering the complete execution of available tasks, the problem of assigning available resources (robot features) to the tasks is computationally complex, which may further increase if the number of tasks increases. Popularly this problem is known as multi-robot coalition formation (MRCF) problem. Genetic algorithms (GAs) have been found to be quite efficient in solving such complex computational problems. There are several GA-based approaches to solve MRCF problems but none of them have considered the dynamic GA variants. This paper considers immigrants-based GAs viz. random immigrants genetic algorithm (RIGA) and elitism based immigrants genetic algorithm (EIGA) for optimal task allocation in MRCF problem. Further, it reports a novel use of these algorithms making them adaptive with certain modifications in their traditional attributes by adaptively choosing the parameters of genetic operators and terms them as adaptive RIGA (aRIGA) and adaptive EIGA (aEIGA). Extensive simulation experiments are conducted for a comparative performance evaluation with respect to standard genetic algorithm (SGA) using three popular performance metrics. A statistical analysis with the analysis of variance has also been performed. It is demonstrated that RIGA and EIGA produce better solutions than SGA for both fixed and adaptive genetic operators. Among them, EIGA and aEIGA outperform RIGA and aRIGA, respectively.},

  abstract = {In this paper, optimal surveillance mission plans are developed to cover disjoint areas of interest (AOIs) over an extended time horizon using multiple aerial vehicles. AOIs to be covered are divided into a number of cells. To promptly update information collected from AOIs and to ensure persistent surveillance, each cell is to be revisited within a time slot. Joint path planning and temporal scheduling is formulated as a combinatorial optimization with the proposal of novel objective functions: 1) maximizing the minimum number of nonrepeatedly covered cells in a sliding-window fashion and 2) maximizing the total number of covered cells in the mission plan. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) with a specific chromosome representation and custom genetic operators, in which the constraint that each cell be revisited within a time slot is transformed into the third objective to handle infeasibility, is developed. The initial single-period paths are generated by solving a series of orienteering problems. The initial population is obtained by connecting these single-period paths and selecting the take-off time for each flight. Three mutation moves are proposed to enable revisiting in a single-period path and rescheduling of take-off time. The solutions converge in the MOEA and are selected by a weighted-sum model according to user preferences in decision making. Simulation results on different mission scenarios and different criteria show the superiority of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm is done offline ahead of the missions and requires modest computational resources.},

Consequently, there is also an increase in unexpected incidents, such as adverse traffic, unavailability of parking space, and vehicle breakdowns. These disruptions result in delays, higher costs, and lower service levels in the last-mile delivery operation. Motivated by free, innovative, and efficient tools, such as the Google application programming interface (API) and Google OR, we built a model to measure the impact of disruptions in the last-mile delivery operation. Our model considers customers’ geographic information, speed estimation between nodes, routing optimisation, and disruption evaluation. Disruptions are considered here as external factors such as accidents and road works that imply the closure of or slow access to certain roads. Computational experiments, based on a set of real data from three different cities around the world, which contrast in size and characteristics (i.e., Boston, US; Bogotá, Colombia; and Pamplona, Spain), were conducted to validate our approach. The tests consider 50 different instances of up to 100 customers per city and analyse the impact of disruptions in terms of travelled time and distance. Our results provide managerial insights for key stakeholders (i.e., carriers, consumers, and government) to define policies and development plans that improve the resilience and capabilities of cities’ transportation systems.},

Our balancing constraint attempts to minimise the travel distance difference among the robots as well as allocates an equal set of tasks to these robots. The clustering-based approach is employed to solve the Balanced Multi-Robot Task Allocation (BMRTA) problem for two principal reasons. That is, this approach clusters given tasks into groups using various clustering techniques for each robot and sequences the route for each robot using the travelling salesman problem (TSP) conhull algorithm. This work analyses the suitability and performance of the clustering techniques with respect to the balancing criteria using a benchmark dataset. Our findings suggest that K-means clustering is the most suitable for the solving BMRTA problem with complex topologies and it is scalable to deal with any number of tasks and robots compared with Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM) and hierarchical clustering methods.},

  abstract = {Control of autonomous vehicles for applications such as surveillance, search, and exploration has been a topic of great interest over the past two decades. In particular, there has been a rising interest in control of multiple vehicles for reasons such as increase in system reliability, robustness, and efficiency, with a possible reduction in cost. The exploration problem is NP hard even for a single vehicle/agent, and the use of multiple vehicles brings forth a whole new suite of problems associated with communication and cooperation between vehicles. The persistent surveillance problem differs from exploration since it involves continuous/repeated coverage of the target space, minimizing time between re-visits. The use of aerial vehicles demands consideration of vehicle dynamic and endurance constraints as well. Another aspect of the problem that has been investigated to a lesser extent is the design of the vehicles for particular missions. The intent of this paper is to thoroughly review the persistent surveillance problem, with particular focus on multiple Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), and present some of our own work in this area. We investigate the different aspects of the problem and slightly digress into techniques that have been applied to exploration and coverage, but a comprehensive survey of all the work in multiple vehicle control for search, exploration, and coverage is beyond the scope of this paper.},

  abstract = {Decision-theoretic planning is a popular approach to sequential decision making problems, because it treats uncertainty in sensing and acting in a principled way. In single-agent frameworks like MDPs and POMDPs, planning can be carried out by resorting to Q-value functions: an optimal Q-value function Q* is computed in a recursive manner by dynamic programming, and then an optimal policy is extracted from Q*. In this paper we study whether similar Q-value functions can be defined for decentralized POMDP models (Dec-POMDPs), and how policies can be extracted from such value functions. We define two forms of the optimal Q-value function for Dec-POMDPs: one that gives a normative description as the Q-value function of an optimal pure joint policy and another one that is sequentially rational and thus gives a recipe for computation. This computation, however, is infeasible for all but the smallest problems. Therefore, we analyze various approximate Q-value functions that allow for efficient computation. We describe how they relate, and we prove that they all provide an upper bound to the optimal Q-value function Q*.  Finally, unifying some previous approaches for solving Dec-POMDPs, we describe a family of algorithms for extracting policies from such Q-value functions, and perform an experimental evaluation on existing test problems, including a new firefighting benchmark problem.},

The planning is restricted to the availability of vehicles and strives to achieve balanced routes. We study an adaptation of the model for the multi-vehicle covering tour problem, in which a set of locations must be visited, whereas another subset must be close enough to the planned routes. It constitutes an NP-complete integer programming problem. Suboptimal solutions are obtained with several heuristics, some adapted from the literature and others developed by us. We solve some adapted instances from TSPLIB and an instance with real data, the former being compared with results from literature, and latter being compared with empirical data.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new flow-based mathematical formulation for the multivehicle covering tour problem. This problem determines a set of vehicle routes for the available fleet; therefore, the total distance traveled is minimal. In the proposed mathematical formulation, each vertex represents a location of interest, and these vertices belong to three sets: vertices that can be visited; vertices that must be visited; and vertices that must be covered, in the sense that each vertex must be close to a visited vertex in a route. The proposed formulation aims to find solutions with balanced routes (all the routes with an equal or similar number of visited nodes) and extends the previous formulations proposed in the literature by considering a two-index vehicle flow formulation with a decision variable to find the balanced routes. It constitutes an NP-hard integer programming problem based on a two-commodity flow model, which is solved by applying the branch-and-cut and biased random-key genetic algorithms. This paper reports computational results for some adapted instances from TSPLIB to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed model. The computational results validate the branch-and-cut and genetic algorithms, whereby the latter performs better in large-size instances with reduced computational runtime. Finally, the used approaches obtained competitive solutions compared to the literature.},

In such cases, utilizing the notion of coverage; i.e., satisfying the demand of multiple customers by visiting a single customer location, may be advantageous. With this motivation, we study the time constrained maximal covering salesman problem (TCMCSP) in which the aim is to find a tour visiting a subset of customers so that the amount of demand covered within a limited time is maximized. We provide flow and cut formulations and derive valid inequalities. Since the connectivity constraints and the proposed valid inequalities are exponential in the size of the problem, we devise different branch-and-cut schemes. Computational experiments performed on a set of problem instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed valid inequalities in terms of strengthening the linear relaxation bounds as well as speeding up the solution procedure. Moreover, the results indicate the superiority of using a branch-and-cut methodology over a flow-based formulation. Finally, we discuss the relation between the problem parameters and the structure of optimal solutions based on the results of our experiments.},

In the classical TOP, a homogeneous fleet of UAVs has to select and visit a subset of customers in order to maximize, subject to a maximum travel time per route, the total reward obtained from these visits. In the TAOP, a number of different tasks (customer services) have to be assigned to a fleet of heterogeneous UAVs, while the best routing plan must also be determined to cover these services.

Reliability issues are also considered, since random times might prevent a route from being successfully completed before a UAV runs out of battery.},

  abstract = {The team orienteering problem (TOP) is an NP-hard optimization problem with an increasing number of potential applications in smart cities, humanitarian logistics, wildfire surveillance, etc. In the TOP, a fixed fleet of vehicles is employed to obtain rewards by visiting nodes in a network. All vehicles share common origin and destination locations. Since each vehicle has a limitation in time or traveling distance, not all nodes in the network can be visited. Hence, the goal is focused on the maximization of the collected reward, taking into account the aforementioned constraints. Most of the existing literature on the TOP focuses on its deterministic version, where rewards and travel times are assumed to be predefined values. This paper focuses on a more realistic TOP version, where travel times are modeled as random variables, which introduces reliability issues in the solutions due to the route-length constraint. In order to deal with these complexities, we propose a simheuristic algorithm that hybridizes biased-randomized heuristics with a variable neighborhood search and MCS. To test the quality of the solutions generated by the proposed simheuristic approach, we employ the well-known sample average approximation (SAA) method, as well as a combination model that hybridizes the metaheuristic used in the simheuristic approach with the SAA algorithm. The results show that our proposed simheuristic outperforms the SAA and the hybrid model both on the objective function values and computational time.},

Taguchi’s design of experiments based parameter tuned genetic algorithm (GA) is developed for generalised task allocation of single-task robots to multi-robot tasks. The developed methodology is tested for 16 scenarios by varying the number of robots and number of tasks. The scenarios were tested in a simulated environment with a maximum of 20 robots and 40 multi-robot foraging tasks. The tradeoff between performance measures for the allocations obtained through GA for different task levels was used to decide the optimal number of robots. It is evident that the tradeoffs occur at 20 per cent of performance measures and the optimal number of robot varies between 10 and 15 for almost all the task levels. This method shows good convergence and found that the precedence constraints affect the optimal number of robots required for a particular task level.},

We consider the disrupted dial-a-ride problem (DARP), where vehicle breakdown can occur at any point of time during the transportation service. The conventional method to handle vehicle breakdown is to own backup vehicles or rent additional vehicles when necessary, so that the impaired vehicles can be replaced if any vehicle breaks down. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive algorithm with GPU-acceleration, to quickly build routes and schedules for the DARP in the occurrence of unforeseen stochastic events. Computational experiments are conducted on various standard DARP instances, with realistic estimates of operational cost. The results show that the new adaptive algorithm reduces the operational cost when compared to the conventional method.},

First, we propose a patrolling strategy and we characterize its performance as a function of the environment and the viewpoints priorities. Second, we restrict our attention to the problem of patrolling a nonintersecting tour, and we describe a team trajectory with minimum weighted refresh time.

  abstract = {The scheduling problem of an Agile Earth Observation Satellite is to schedule a subset of weighted observation tasks with each a specific “profit” in order to maximize the total collected profit, under its operational constraints. The “time-dependent transition time” and the “time-dependent profit” are two crucial features of this problem. The former relates to the fact that each pair of consecutive tasks requires a transition time to maneuver the look angle of the camera from the previous task to the next task. The latter follows from the fact that a different look angle of an observation leads to a different image quality, i.e., the collected profit. Since the specific look angle of a task depends on its observation start time, both the transition time and the profit are “time-dependent”. We present a concept of “minimal transition time” to displace the transition time. On this basis, a bidirectional dynamic programming based iterated local search (BDP-ILS) algorithm is proposed, equipped with an insert procedure that avoids a full feasibility check. The bidirectional dynamic programming approach is integrated into the algorithm in order to efficiently evaluate a solution or an insert move when time-dependent profits are considered. Two types of experiments (with and without the time-dependent profits) are designed to evaluate the performance. The results without time-dependent profits show that our algorithm outperforms the state of the art in terms of solution quality and computational time. When time-dependent profits are considered, our BDP-ILS algorithm performs very well on smaller instances with a known optimal solution and on larger instances compared to four reference algorithms.},

In this problem, a set of candidate targets for observation is given, each with a time-dependent profit and a visible time window. The exact profit of a target depends on the start time of its observation, reaching its maximum at the midpoint of its visible time window. This time dependency stems from the fact that the image quality is determined by the look angle between the satellite and the target to be observed. We present an exact algorithm for the single-orbit scheduling for an AEOS considering the time-dependent profits. The algorithm is called Adaptive-directional Dynamic Programming with Decremental State Space Relaxation (ADP-DSSR). This algorithm is based on the dynamic programming approach for the Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW). Several algorithmic improvements are proposed to address the time-dependent profits. The proposed algorithm is evaluated based on extensive computational tests. The experimental results show that the algorithmic improvements significantly reduce the required computational time. The comparison between the proposed exact algorithm and a state-of-the-art heuristic illustrates that our algorithm can find the optimal solutions for sufficiently large instances within limited computational time. The results also show that our algorithm is capable of efficiently solving benchmark OPTW instances.},

We call the introduced OP variant the physical OP (POP). The POP sets out to determine a feasible, collision-free, path that maximizes collected reward from a subset of the target locations and does not exceed the given travel budget. The problem combines motion planning and combinatorial optimization to visit multiple target locations. The proposed solution to the POP is based on the variable neighborhood search (VNS) method combined with the asymptotically optimal sampling-based probabilistic roadmap (PRM*) method. The VNS-PRM* uses initial low-dense roadmap that is continuously expanded during the VNSbased POP optimization to shorten paths of the promising solutions and, thus, allows maximizing the sum of the collected rewards. The computational results support the feasibility of the proposed approach by a fast determination of high-quality solutions. Moreover, an experimental verification demonstrates the applicability of the proposed VNS-PRM* approach for data collection planning for an unmanned aerial vehicle in an urban-like environment with obstacles.},

However, the possible sample space is large and the corresponding graph-partitioning problem is NP-complete. Moreover, the resulting patrol beats must be contiguous and compact. We propose a heuristic based, clustering method to divide a given police district into optimal patrol beats based on crime and census data. Use of past crime data, their severity, and census data results in more compact shapes with lower crime response time and equitable workload. Moreover, it enables defining patrol beats for different seasons and time shifts. Furthermore, we considered the actual road distance than the traditional Euclidean distance in responding to crimes. We demonstrated the utility of the proposed method using a real-world crime and census dataset. For the given dataset, maximum response time for Calls For Service (CFS) was 35.2 seconds, which is the time taken to travel to any point in the patrol beat from the optimum positioning of police patrol car. Compactness was measured using Isoperimetric Quotient values for each patrol beat, and the average compactness was 0.7 indicating good compactness. Gini Coefficient was 0.036, which indicates balanced workload distribution among patrol beats.},

These are (1) type of problem, (2) logistical context, (3) transportation mode, (4) objective function, (5) fleet size, (6) time constraints, (7) vehicle capacity constraints, (8) the ability to reject customers, (9) the nature of the dynamic element, (10) the nature of the stochasticity (if any), and (11) the solution method. We comment on technological vis-à-vis methodological advances for this class of problems and suggest directions for further research.

  abstract = {Multi-tote storage and retrieval (MTSR) autonomous mobile robots can carry multiple product totes, store and retrieve them from different shelf rack tiers, and transport them to a workstation where the products are picked to fulfill customer orders. In each robot trip, totes retrieved during the previous trip must be stored. This leads to a mixed storage and retrieval route. We analyze this mixed storage and retrieval route problem and derive the optimal travel route for a multiblock warehouse by a layered graph algorithm, based on storage first-retrieval second and mixed storage and retrieval policies. We also propose an effective heuristic routing policy, the closest retrieval (CR) sequence policy, based on a local shortest path. Numerical results show that the CR policy leads to shorter travel times than the well-known S-shape policy, whereas the gap with the optimal mixed storage and retrieval policy in practical scenarios is small. Based on the CR policy, we model the stochastic behavior of the system using a semiopen queuing network (SOQN). This model can accurately estimate average tote throughput time and system throughput capacity as a function of the number of robots in the system. We use the SOQN and corresponding closed queuing network models to optimize the total annual cost as a function of the warehouse shape, the number of robots, and tote buffer positions on the robots for a given average tote throughput time and throughput capacity. Compared with robots that retrieve a single tote per trip, an MTSR system with at least five buffer positions can achieve lower operational costs while meeting given average tote throughput time and tote throughput capacity constraints.

After the lockdown, they had to be collected by a reduced group of volunteer drivers, who transported them to several consolidation centers. These activities required a daily agile design of efficient routes, especially considering that routes should not exceed a maximum time threshold to minimize drivers’ exposure. These constraints limit the number of houses that could be visited. Moreover, travel and service times are considered as random variables. This logistics challenge is modeled as a stochastic team orienteering problem. Our main performance indicator is the collected reward, which should be maximized.

The problem is a generalisation of the vehicle routing problem with time windows. Required travel time between visits and time windows of the visits must be respected. The challenge when assigning visits to home carers lies in the existence of soft preference constraints and in temporal dependencies between the start times of visits. We model the problem as a set partitioning problem with side constraints and develop an exact branch-and-price solution algorithm, as this method has previously given solid results for classical vehicle routing problems. Temporal dependencies are modelled as generalised precedence constraints and enforced through the branching. We introduce a novel visit clustering approach based on the soft preference constraints. The algorithm is tested both on real-life problem instances and on generated test instances inspired by realistic settings. The use of the specialised branching scheme on real-life problems is novel. The visit clustering decreases run times significantly, and only gives a loss of quality for few instances. Furthermore, the visit clustering allows us to find solutions to larger problem instances, which cannot be solved to optimality.},

  abstract = {In the context of parcel delivery, aerial drones have great potential that particularly applies in rural areas. In these areas drones mostly operate faster than trucks. As drones are limited in their payload, a combination of trucks and drones can be beneficial in reducing last-mile delivery costs. There are two different delivery methods that combine truck and drone delivery: trucks and drones collaborating with each other with drones launched from trucks, and trucks and drones serving customers independently of each other with drones launched from microdepots or the central distribution center. We develop a tactical planning model that decides on the cost-optimal vehicle fleet and the location of dedicated drone stations of a logistics service provider that minimizes total costs. The problem setting is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program that allows the assessment of benefits of different transport concepts as well as the impact of mixing different delivery modes. To solve larger instances we develop a specialized adaptive large neighborhood search. We present a numerical study for parcel delivery in a rural area where customers live in scattered settlements, e.g., villages or hamlets. The case study shows that it is best to launch drones both from trucks and dedicated drone stations in 58\% of all scenarios considered. This fleet mix leads to average cost savings of 33.3\% compared to an only truck scenario and 14.1\% if trucks and drones launched from trucks are considered for delivery. Moreover, we find 17 new best-known solutions for benchmark instances from the literature.},

  abstract = {Objectives Decades of empirical research demonstrate that crime is concentrated at a range of spatial scales, including street segments. Further, the degree of clustering at particular geographic units remains noticeably stable and consistent; a finding that Weisburd (Criminology 53:133–157, 2015) has recently termed the ‘law of crime concentration at places’. Such findings suggest that the future locations of crime should—to some extent at least—be predictable. To date, methods of forecasting where crime is most likely to next occur have focused either on area-level or grid-based predictions. No studies of which we are aware have developed and tested the accuracy of methods for predicting the future risk of crime at the street segment level. This is surprising given that it is at this level of place that many crimes are committed and policing resources are deployed. Methods Using data for property crimes for a large UK metropolitan police force area, we introduce and calibrate a network-based version of prospective crime mapping [e.g. Bowers et al. (Br J Criminol 44:641–658, 2004)], and compare its performance against grid-based alternatives. We also examine how measures of predictive accuracy can be translated to the network context, and show how differences in performance between the two cases can be quantified and tested. Results Findings demonstrate that the calibrated network-based model substantially outperforms a grid-based alternative in terms of predictive accuracy, with, for example, approximately 20 \% more crime identified at a coverage level of 5 \%. The improvement in accuracy is highly statistically significant at all coverage levels tested (from 1 to 10 \%). Conclusions This study suggests that, for property crime at least, network-based methods of crime forecasting are likely to outperform grid-based alternatives, and hence should be},

  abstract = {Objectives Decades of empirical research demonstrate that crime is concentrated at a range of spatial scales, including street segments. Further, the degree of clustering at particular geographic units remains noticeably stable and consistent; a finding that Weisburd (Criminology 53:133–157, 2015) has recently termed the ‘law of crime concentration at places’. Such findings suggest that the future locations of crime should—to some extent at least—be predictable. To date, methods of forecasting where crime is most likely to next occur have focused either on area-level or grid-based predictions. No studies of which we are aware have developed and tested the accuracy of methods for predicting the future risk of crime at the street segment level. This is surprising given that it is at this level of place that many crimes are committed and policing resources are deployed. Methods Using data for property crimes for a large UK metropolitan police force area, we introduce and calibrate a network-based version of prospective crime mapping [e.g. Bowers et al. (Br J Criminol 44:641–658, 2004)], and compare its performance against grid-based alternatives. We also examine how measures of predictive accuracy can be translated to the network context, and show how differences in performance between the two cases can be quantified and tested. Results Findings demonstrate that the calibrated network-based model substantially outperforms a grid-based alternative in terms of predictive accuracy, with, for example, approximately 20 \% more crime identified at a coverage level of 5 \%. The improvement in accuracy is highly statistically significant at all coverage levels tested (from 1 to 10 \%). Conclusions This study suggests that, for property crime at least, network-based methods of crime forecasting are likely to outperform grid-based alternatives, and hence should be},

  abstract = {Improving the travel experience is a goal of tourist destinations. Tourists demand information and services that help plan and organise the trips adapted to their preferences and resources. Intelligent systems, recommendation systems, and electronic tourist guides can play a decisive role in tourist satisfaction and shaping the offer at the destination. These systems must satisfy the interests of tourists which travel alone or as a group. However, the development of these tools to generate group tourism itineraries is still limited. Group itineraries must also consider individual preferences and the selection of transport modes. The problem associated with the construction of tourist routes is called the Tourist Trip Design Problem. In this work, an extension of the Team Orienteering Problem with Time Windows is developed to model tourism planning. The model considers the construction of group routes, a cost and time limit associated with each participant, the selection of the mode of transport to go from one location to another, and heterogeneous preferences in the group. The model aims to maximise the preferences of group members by considering real and challenging constraints that increase complexity and avoid solutions in polynomial time. This is a novel model, and we generate sets of instances to assess the accuracy of our solution approach. A Greedy Randomised Adaptive Search Procedure is proposed to solve the model. Evaluation criteria based on time, cost, and preferences are used to guide the candidate’s selection in the construction phase. The results provided by our meta-heuristic are compared with those obtained by solving the Mixed Integer Programming formulation with exact solver. Computational results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {A well-crafted police patrol route design is vital in providing community safety and security in the society. Previous works have largely focused on predicting crime events with historical crime data. The usage of large-scale mobility data collected from Location-Based Social Network, or check-ins, and Point of Interests (POI) data for designing an effective police patrol is largely understudied. Given that there are multiple police officers being on duty in a real-life situation, this makes the problem more complex to solve. In this paper, we formulate the dynamic crime patrol planning problem for multiple police officers using check-ins, crime, incident response data, and POI information. We propose a joint learning and non-random optimisation method for the representation of possible solutions where multiple police officers patrol the high crime risk areas simultaneously first rather than the low crime risk areas. Later, meta-heuristic Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Cuckoo Search (CS) are implemented to find the optimal routes. The performance of the proposed solution is verified and compared with several state-of-art methods using real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Nowadays humanoid robots have generally made dramatic progress, which can form a coalition replacing human work in dangerous environments such as rescue, defense, exploration, etc. In contrast to other types of robots, humanoid robots’ similarity to human make them more suitable for performing such a wide range of tasks. Rescue applications for robots, especially for humanoid robots are exciting. In rescue operating conditions, tasks’ dependencies, tasks’ repetitive accomplishment requirements, robots’ energy consumption, and total tasks’ accomplishment time are key factors. This paper investigates a practical variant of the Multi-Robots Task Allocation (MRTA) problem for humanoid robots as multi-humanoid robots’ task allocation (MHTA) problem. In order to evaluate relevant aspects of the MHTA problem, we proposed a robust Multi-Objective MultiHumanoid Robots Task allocation (MO-MHTA) algorithm with four objectives, namely energy consumption, total tasks’ accomplishment time, robot’s idle time and fairness were optimized simultaneously in an evolutionary framework in MOMHTA, which address for the first time. MO-MHTA exhibits multi-objective properties in real-world applications for humanoid robots in two phases. In the first phase, the tasks are partitioned in a fair manner with a proposed constraint k-medoid (CKM) algorithm. In the second phase, a new non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm with special genetic operators is applied. Evaluations based on extensive experiments on the newly proposed benchmark instances with three robust multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are applied. The proposed algorithm achieves favorable results in comparison to six other algorithms. Besides, the proposed algorithm can be seen as benchmark algorithms for real-world MO-MHTA instances.},

In this paper, an existing computational framework, based on recourse strategies, is adapted to meet the objectives of the SS-VRP-R. The resulting models are applied to a real case study of the management of police units in Brussels. In this context, the expected average response time is minimized. To cope with the reality of the urban context, a time-dependent variant is also studied (TD-SS-VRP-R) in which the travel time between two locations is a function that depends on the departure time at the first location. Experiments confirm the contribution and the adaptability of the recourse strategies to a real-life, complex operational context. Provided an adequate solution method, simulation-based results show the high quality of the a priori solutions designed, even when compared to those designed by field experts. Finally, the experiments provide evidence that there is no potential gain in considering time-dependency in such an operational context.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the authors consider the vehicle routing problem (VRP) with stochastic demand and/or dynamic requests. The classical VRP consists of determining a set of routes starting and ending at a depot that provide service to a set of customers. Stochastic demands are only revealed when the vehicle arrives at the customer location; dynamic requests mean that new orders from previously unknown customers can be received and scheduled over time. The variable neighborhood search algorithm (VNS) proposed in this study can be extended by sampling for stochastic scenarios and adapted for the dynamic setting. We use standard sets of benchmark instances to evaluate our algorithms. When applying sampling based VNS, on average we were able to improve results obtained by a classical VNS by 4.39~\%. Individual instances could be improved by up to 8.12~\%. In addition, the proposed VNS framework matches 32 out of 40 best known solutions and provides one new best solution. In the dynamic case, VNS improves on existing results and provides new best solutions for 7 out of 21 instances. Finally, this study offers results for stochastic and dynamic scenarios. Our experiments show that the sampling based dynamic VNS provides better results when the demand deviation is small, and reduces the excess route duration by 45–90~\%.},

To address this issue, this paper studies an extension of the classical rural postman problem, where a fleet of rechargeable vehicles with limited battery capacity stationed at multiple depots must traverse required edges in a weighted graph through multiple trips, minimizing the total travel time. Existing heuristic approaches yield poor solutions with a high optimality gap due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. We propose a new Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation for the problem, which is used to obtain optimal vehicle routes and introduce new techniques to enhance existing metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithm, to solve the problem. The routes obtained by testing the metaheuristics on benchmark and real-world instances based on roadmaps were compared to the optimal solution. Experimental results for benchmark instances showed that the simulated annealing and genetic algorithm kept the optimality gap within 1\%. For real-world instances, simulated annealing and tabu search improved route quality by 54.1\% and 49.9\%, respectively, over routes obtained by only using heuristic approaches.},

  abstract = {Icy roads can cause many accidents due to their slippery nature. Thus, providing people the information about icy roads can help them avoid taking these roads and prevent accidents. The problem of routing UAVs optimally to collect visual information regarding icy roads is called Icy Road Vehicle Routing Problem.Vehicle Routing Problem is essentially a path planning problem, where optimal paths need to be determined for one or more vehicles. Arc Routing Problems is a subclass of vehicle routing problems where the goal is to make vehicle(s) traverse specific arcs or edges optimally. Icy road vehicle routing problem resembles arc routing problem when icy roads are considered as arcs. Usually, in arc routing problems, vehicle(s) are located in one specific location, and the solution routes start and end at the same location.This thesis defines the Icy Road Vehicle Routing Problem, a new type of arc routing problem, where the goal of traversing arcs or icy roads remains the same but vehicle(s) or UAV(s) are located at one or multiple location(s). The thesis also presents new heuristic-based algorithms called multi-flight algorithms to solve the Icy Road Vehicle Routing Problem. By performing a set of experiments, the proposed algorithms are compared against several heuristic-based approaches from the literature. These experimental results show that the proposed multi-flight algorithms produced quicker and better quality solution routes to the UAVs for the Icy Road Vehicle Routing Problem than previous heuristics.},

In particular, each robot traverses a closed tour periodically and meets with the robots on neighboring tours to exchange data. We model the problem as a variant of the min-max vertex cycle cover problem (MMCCP), which is the problem of covering all vertices with a given number of disjoint tours such that the longest tour length is minimal. In this work, we introduce the minimum idleness connectivity-constrained multirobot patrolling problem, show that it is NP-hard, and model it as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The computational complexity of exactly solving this problem restrains practical applications, and therefore we develop approximate algorithms taking a solution for MMCCP as input. Our simulation experiments on 10 vertices and up to 3 robots compare the results of different solution approaches (including solving the MILP formulation) and show that our greedy algorithm can obtain an objective value close to the one of the MILP formulations but requires much less computation time. Experiments on instances with up to 100 vertices and 10 robots indicate that the greedy approximation algorithm tries to keep the length of the longest tour small by extending smaller tours for data exchange.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot patrolling represents a fundamental problem for many monitoring and surveillance applications and has gained significant interest in recent years. In patrolling, mobile robots repeatedly travel through an environment, capture sensor data at certain sensing locations and deliver this data to the base station in a way that maximizes the changes of detection. Robots move on tours, exchange data when they meet with robots on neighboring tours and so eventually deliver data to the base station. In this paper we jointly consider two important optimization criteria of multi-robot patrolling: (i) idleness, i.e. the time between consecutive visits of sensing locations, and (ii) delay, i.e. the time between capturing data at the sensing location and its arrival at the base station. We systematically investigate the effect of the robots’ moving directions along their tours and the selection of meeting points for data exchange. We prove that the problem of determining the movement directions and meeting points such that the data delay is minimized is NP-hard. For this purpose, we define a structure called tour graph which models the neighborhood of the tours defined by potential meeting points. We propose two heuristics that are based on a shortest-path-search in the tour graph. We provide a simulation study which shows that the cooperative approach can outperform an uncooperative approach where every robot delivers the captured data individually to the base station. Additionally, the experiments show that the heuristic which is computational more expensive performs slightly better on average than the less expensive heuristic in the considered scenarios.},

  abstract = {Territory-based routing approaches (TBRAs) are commonly used to achieve high service consistency, e.g., in the small package shipping industry, but their drawback is a decline in routing flexibility. Consequently, a high percentage of time-definite deliveries, as common in the small package shipping sector, should have a significant negative effect on the solution quality of TBRAs. To the best of our knowledge, no study exists on the magnitude of this effect and the factors that influence it. Therefore, we develop a two-phase TBRA and use it (i) to investigate the design requirements of a TBRA for successfully handling time windows, and (ii) to study the influence of time window constraints on the performance of such an approach. We find that the consideration of geographical aspects in the districting is paramount for generating high-quality territories, whereas explicitly incorporating time window characteristics and historical demand data does not lead to a perceptible improvement of the solution quality. Moreover, the efficiency and feasibility forfeits of our TBRA in comparison to daily route reoptimization (RR) are larger if time windows are present. However, significantly higher consistency improvements compared to RR are achieved for time-constrained problems. This is due to the fact that RR solutions to time-definite problems exhibit lower consistency and thus a higher potential for improvement by using a TBRA, which constitutes an important insight for practitioners.},

  abstract = {Planning the election campaign for leaders of a political party is a complex problem. The party representatives, running mates, and campaign managers have to design an efficient routing and scheduling plan to visit multiple locations while respecting time and budget constraints. Given the limited time of election campaigns in most countries, every minute should be used effectively, and there is very little room for error. In this paper, we formalize this problem as the multiple Roaming Salesman Problem (mRSP), a new variant of the recently introduced Roaming Salesman Problem (RSP), where a predefined number of political representatives visit a set of cities during a planning horizon to maximize collected rewards, subject to budget and time constraints. Cities can be visited more than once and associated rewards are time-dependent (increasing over time) according to the day of the visit and the recency of previous visits. We develop a compact Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation complemented with effective valid inequalities. Since commercial solvers can obtain optimal solutions only for small-sized instances, we develop a Learning-based Granular Variable Neighborhood Search and demonstrate its capability of providing high-quality solutions in short CPU times on real-world instances. The adaptive nature of our algorithm refers to its ability to dynamically adjust the neighborhood structure based on the progress of the search. Our algorithm generates the best-known results for many instances.},

  abstract = {Multi-object transport using multi-robot systems has the potential for diverse practical applications such as delivery services owing to its efficient individual and scalable cooperative transport. However, allocating transportation tasks of objects with unknown weights remains challenging. Moreover, the presence of infeasible tasks (untransportable objects) can lead to robot stoppage (deadlock). This paper proposes a framework for dynamic task allocation that involves storing task experiences for each task in a scalable manner with respect to the number of robots. First, these experiences are broadcasted from the cloud server to the entire robot system. Subsequently, each robot learns the exclusion levels for each task based on those task experiences, enabling it to exclude infeasible tasks and reset its task priorities. Finally, individual transportation, cooperative transportation, and the temporary exclusion of tasks considered infeasible are achieved. The scalability and versatility of the proposed method were confirmed through numerical experiments with an increased number of robots and objects, including unlearned weight objects. The effectiveness of the temporary deadlock avoidance was also confirmed by introducing additional robots within an episode. The proposed method enables the implementation of task allocation strategies that are feasible for different numbers of robots and various transport tasks without prior consideration of feasibility.},

  abstract = {The Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem (CTOP) is a challenging combinatorial optimization problem, wherein a fleet of vehicles traverses multiple locations, each with distinct prizes, demand weights, and service times. The primary objective is to determine optimal routes for the vehicles that collectively accumulate the highest total prize within capacity and time constraints. The CTOP finds applications across various domains such as disaster response, maintenance, marketing, tourism, and surveillance, where coordinated teams are required to efficiently explore and gather prizes from different sites. The complexity of this problem is further compounded by uncertainties in predicting specific attributes of each location, making it hard to plan routes accurately in advance. In numerous scenarios in practice, subjective predictions for these parameters may exist, but their precise values remain unknown until a location is visited by one of the vehicles. Given the unpredictable nature of these parameters, there is a pressing need for innovative online optimization strategies that can adapt to new information, ensuring the strategic allocation of resources and route planning within set constraints. To address this challenging online optimization problem, we offer a detailed analysis through the lens of theoretical and empirical competitive ratios. We derive an exact tight upper bound on the competitive ratio of online algorithms, and we introduce three novel online algorithms, with two of them achieving optimal competitive ratios. The third algorithm is a polynomial time approximation-based online algorithm with a competitive ratio of 13.53 times the tight upper bound. To evaluate our algorithms, we measure their empirical competitive ratios on randomly generated instances as well as instances from the literature. Our empirical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our solutions across a diverse range of simulation scenarios.},

This problem models many multirobot routing tasks, such as exploring unknown environments and information gathering for environmental monitoring. In this article, we focus on how to make the robot team robust to failures when operating in adversarial environments. We introduce the robust multiple-path orienteering problem (RMOP), where we seek worst case guarantees against an adversary that is capable of attacking at most α robots. We consider two versions of this problem: RMOP offline and RMOP online. In the offline version, there is no communication or replanning when robots execute their plans, and our main contribution is a general approximation scheme with a bounded approximation guarantee that depends on α and the approximation factor for single-robot orienteering. In particular, we show that the algorithm yields a: 1) constant-factor approximation when the cost function is modular; 2) log factor approximation when the cost function is submodular; and 3) constant-factor approximation when the cost function is submodular, but the robots are allowed to exceed their path budgets by a bounded amount. In the online version, the RMOP is modeled as a two-player sequential game and solved adaptively in a receding horizon fashion based on Monte Carlo tree search. In addition to theoretical analysis, we perform simulation studies for ocean monitoring and tunnel information-gathering applications to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.},

  abstract = {Teams of mobile [aerial, ground, or aquatic] robots have applications in resource delivery, patrolling, information-gathering, agriculture, forest fire fighting, chemical plume source localization and mapping, and search-and-rescue. Robot teams traversing hazardous environments -- with e.g. rough terrain or seas, strong winds, or adversaries capable of attacking or capturing robots -- should plan and coordinate their trails in consideration of risks of disablement, destruction, or capture. Specifically, the robots should take the safest trails, coordinate their trails to cooperatively achieve the team-level objective with robustness to robot failures, and balance the reward from visiting locations against risks of robot losses. Herein, we consider bi-objective trail-planning for a mobile team of robots orienteering in a hazardous environment. The hazardous environment is abstracted as a directed graph whose arcs, when traversed by a robot, present known probabilities of survival. Each node of the graph offers a reward to the team if visited by a robot (which e.g. delivers a good to or images the node). We wish to search for the Pareto-optimal robot-team trail plans that maximize two [conflicting] team objectives: the expected (i) team reward and (ii) number of robots that survive the mission. A human decision-maker can then select trail plans that balance, according to their values, reward and robot survival. We implement ant colony optimization, guided by heuristics, to search for the Pareto-optimal set of robot team trail plans. As a case study, we illustrate with an information-gathering mission in an art museum.},

Current research in this field focuses mainly on detecting penetration attempts, but not on responding. Requiring the robots to also inspect and handle the penetrations has a significant impact on the patrol, as each penetration attempt also influences the robots' behavior, making them vulnerable to multiple attacks. Moreover, a knowledgeable adversary can initiate two sequential attacks, where the second attempt exploits the vulnerable points caused by the requirement that a robot handle the first penetration attempt. In this work, we consider the problem of sequential attacks and examine different robot policies against such adversarial behavior. We provide an optimal patrol strategy for various penetration attempt patterns. Our novel approach considers a full history-length policy, while previous work only handled very limited lengths of history. The use of a longer history improves the results. Moreover, we show how to significantly reduce, in practice, the exponential space state of the problem, while maintaining the optimality of the solution.},

In this paper, we propose a cost effective learning-based heuristic technique to minimize the routing cost along with the potential cost due to the risk of vehicle breakdown and cargo delivery failure. The approach is elaborated by means of an illustrative case study, and it is accompanied by benchmark results along with a comparative study.

To enhance the system performance when designing layouts for such robotic cellular manufacturing systems, the positions of robots and other manufacturing system components must be appropriately determined by considering the sequence of tasks the robots conduct during the assembly process. This paper proposes a new multiobjective layout design optimization technique for robotic cellular manufacturing system layouts that can simultaneously determine the positions of manufacturing components and also task scheduling. First, in this paper, sequence-pair representation is used to specify layout design candidates that inherently avoid interference between assembly system components, and the use of dummy components is introduced to represent layout areas that provide necessary and appropriate spacing between manufacturing system components. In addition, task allocations for each robot are considered as discrete design variables. The design criteria for robot cellular manufacturing system layout designs are clarified and the layout design problem is formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. To solve the optimization problem, a method based on a multiobjective genetic algorithm is proposed and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

We present a multi-objective mathematical model and propose a bound-guided hybrid estimation of distribution algorithm to solve the problem. When designing the optimization algorithm, we adopt estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to tackle the task assignment, and design a non-dominated robot allocation (NGRA) heuristic which is embedded into the EDA to allocate suitable robot to each workstation. Moreover, we propose a bound-guided sampling (BGS) method, which is able to reduce the search space of EDA and focus the search on the promising area. The computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is analyzed and the effectiveness of the proposed NGRA and BGS is tested. In addition, we compare the performances of the proposed mathematical model and the proposed algorithm with those of the existing model and algorithms on a set of widely-used benchmark instances. Comparative results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithm.},

Based on the actual patrol process, our model presents an overlapping patrol model and addresses patrol routing design and fleet allocation in a single integrated model. The objective is to minimize the overall average incident response time. Two strategies—overlapping patrol and non-overlapping patrol—are compared in our paper. Matrix encoding is applied in the genetic algorithm (GA), and to maintain population diversity and avoid premature convergence, a niche strategy is incorporated into the traditional genetic algorithm. Meanwhile, an elitist strategy is employed to speed up the convergence. Using numerical experiments conducted based on data from the Sioux Falls network, we clearly show that: overlapping patrol strategy is superior to non-overlapping patrol strategy; the GA outperforms the simulated annealing (SA) algorithm; and the computational efficiency can be improved when LINGO software is used to solve the problem of fleet allocation.},

  abstract = {Electric vehicles (EVs) are promising alternative to conventional vehicles, due to their low fuel cost and low emissions. As a subset of EVs, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) backup batteries with combustion engines, and thus have a longer traveling range than battery electric vehicles (BEVs). However, the energy cost of a PHEV is higher than a BEV because the gasoline price is higher than the electricity price. Hence, choosing a route with more charging opportunities may result in less fuel cost than the shortest route. Different with the traditional shortest-path and shortest-time routing methods, we propose a new routing choice with the lowest fuel cost for PHEV drivers. Existing algorithms for gasoline vehicles cannot be applied because they never considered the regenerative braking which may result in negative energy consumption on some road segments. Existing algorithms for BEVs are not competent too because PHEVs have two power sources. Thus, even if along the same route, different options of power source will lead to different energy consumption. This paper proposes a cost-optimal algorithm (COA) to deal with the challenges. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using real-world maps and data. The results show that there is a trade-off between traveling cost and time consumed when driving PHEVs. It is also observed that the average detour rate caused by COA is less than 14\%. Significantly, the algorithm averagely saves more than 48\% energy cost compared to the shortest-time routing.},

In disaster rescue, due to the dynamics of environments, heterogeneity and complexity of tasks as well as limited available agents, it is hard for the single-objective and single (task)-to-single (agent) task allocation approaches to handle task allocation in such circumstances. To this end, two multi-objective coalition formation for task allocation models are proposed for disaster rescues in this paper. First, through coalition formation, the proposed models enable agents to cooperatively perform complex tasks that cannot be completed by single agent. In addition, through adjusting the weights of multiple task allocation objectives, the proposed models can employ the linear programming to generate more adaptive task allocation plans, which can satisfy different task allocation requirements in disaster rescue. Finally, through employing the multi-stage task allocation mechanism of the dynamic programming, the proposed models can handle the dynamics of tasks and agents in disaster environments. Experimental results indicate that the proposed models have good performance on coalition formation for task allocation in disaster environments, which can generate suitable task allocation plans according to various objectives of task allocation.},

It is necessary to consider frequencies of passages for each road and response time for emergency calls. However, existing works have focused on either the frequencies or the response time. In order to satisfy the frequency constraints and minimize the response time, it is necessary to patrol while keeping the geographical balance among patrol units. We proposed a route planning method to minimize the response time estimated by using Network Voronoi Diagram (NVD). The NVD represents the area in which each unit is dispatched. We calculate the response time in accordance with the NVD on the units’ allocation. The routes are optimized using Local Search (LS) based on the average response time over each time period. In our experiments, the proposed method is compared with a random patrol method modeled as one of police patrol means in the real world. The experimental results show the response time is improved in most cases if the routes are organized using our method.},

  abstract = {Security is achieved when people feel reassured and safe, hence that, governments of countries seek to become a role model by achieving peace. Here comes the role of the security systems and police. There are three main types of patrols such as land patrols, marine patrols, and air force patrols. Police are assigned to combat various kinds of crimes and carry many tasks such as search and rescue operations, securing and organizing events. Therefore, the time and location where crimes occur should be predicted, so that all the needed procedures are taken. Further it becomes very necessary to optimize police patrol routes, as this will lead to crimes prevention or to arrest the perpetrators. Accordingly, the main purpose of this study is to classify the most common objectives and problems facing the police, and the methods and models used in order to solve them. A systematic literature review is the methodology used to conduct this study, by focusing on previous studies aimed to optimize patrol routes and prevent crimes. The study relied and focused on 31 selected research papers to compare and clarify models used in crimes prediction and patrols optimization. The study classified crime prediction and patrol routes optimization methods into five main methods: machine learning, mathematical, simulation, stochastic, and recommendation system methods.},

  abstract = {Executing time-sensitive multi-robot missions involves two distinct problems: Multi-Robot Task Assignment (MRTA) and Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). Computing safe paths that complete every task and minimize the time to mission completion, or makespan, is a significant computational challenge even for small teams. In many missions, tasks can be generated during execution which is typically handled by either recomputing task assignments and paths from scratch, or by modifying existing plans using approximate approaches. While performing task reassignment and path finding from scratch produces theoretically optimal results, the computational load makes it too expensive for online implementation. In this work, we present Time-Sensitive Online Task Assignment and Navigation (TSOTAN), a framework which can quickly incorporate online generated tasks while guaranteeing bounded suboptimal task assignment makespans. It does this by assessing the quality of partial task reassignments and only performing a complete reoptimization when the makespan exceeds a user specified suboptimality bound. Through experiments in 2D environments we demonstrate TSOTAN's ability to produce quality solutions with computation times suitable for online implementation.},

For several years, LEAs have utilized geographic information systems (GISs) to better understand the spatial nature of crimes and possible spatiotemporal patterns. While previous analyses have yielded spatial clusters of high crime areas (i.e., hot spots), these analyses have lacked specificity at the street level. This research builds on the concept of a hot spot area and creates linear statistically significant spatial crime clusters at the street level, namely hot streets. The identification of hot streets has the potential to assist LEAs in reducing crime through increased patrolling and refocusing efforts at the street level. This study created a GIS-based geoprocessing model to analyze different crime types at varying temporal scales and in different cities (Atlanta, Georgia and Houston, Texas), classifying streets based on four crime cluster confidence levels. The research found that the geoprocessing model successfully streamlined the creation of crime hot streets in the two study areas, led to the development of multi-scale hot street maps, and can be used and edited by anyone who wants to perform linear cluster analysis in other topics.},

  abstract = {The growth of e-commerce has increased demand for last-mile deliveries, increasing the level of congestion in the existing transportation infrastructure in urban areas. Crowdsourcing deliveries can provide the additional capacity needed to meet the growing demand in a cost-effective way. We introduce a setting where a crowd-shipping platform sells heterogeneous products of different sizes from a central depot. Items sold vary from groceries to electronics. Some items must be delivered within a time window, whereas others need a customer signature. Furthermore, customer presence is not guaranteed, and some deliveries may need to be returned to the depot. Delivery requests are fulfilled by a fleet of professional drivers and a pool of crowd drivers. We present a crowd-shipping platform that standardizes crowd drivers’ capacities and compensates them to return undelivered packages back to the depot. We formulate a two-stage stochastic model, and we propose a branch and price algorithm to solve the problem exactly and a column generation heuristic to solve larger problems quickly. We further develop an analytical method to calculate upper bounds on the supply of vehicles and an innovative cohesive pricing problem to generate columns for the pool of crowd drivers. Computational experiments are carried out on modified Solomon instances with a pool of 100 crowd vehicles. The branch and price algorithm is able to solve instances of up to 100 customers. We show that the value of the stochastic solution can be as high as 18\% when compared with the solution obtained from a deterministic simplification of the model. Significant cost reductions of up to 28\% are achieved by implementing crowd drivers with low compensations or higher capacities. Finally, we evaluate what happens when crowd drivers are given the autonomy to select routes based on rational and irrational behavior. There is no cost increase when crowd drivers are rational and select routes that have a higher compensation first. However, when crowd drivers are irrational and select routes randomly, the cost can increase up to 4.2\% for some instances.},

It builds upon existing distributed task allocation algorithms, extending them with a novel method for maximizing the number of task assignments. The fundamental idea is that a task assignment to a robot has a high cost if its reassignment to another robot creates a feasible time slot for unallocated tasks. Multiple reassignments among networked robots may be required to create a feasible time slot and an upper limit to this number of reassignments can be adjusted according to performance requirements. A simulated rescue scenario with task deadlines and fuel limits is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method compared with existing methods, the consensus-based bundle algorithm and the performance impact (PI) algorithm. Starting from existing (PI-generated) solutions, results show up to a 20\% increase in task allocations using the proposed method.},

Current research on content distribution has been focused on designing efficient protocols, but it has put little effort in modeling the nature of the applications that consume and generate those contents, or in studying the internetworking with cellular networks. This paper studies the effects of application characteristics on the performance of push- and pull-based content distribution protocols in VANETs. In particular, it considers the total number of contents being distributed, the popularity of those contents, and the utilization of a cellular backup network to guarantee a level of service for delay-bounded applications. We also propose the Multi-Hop To Infostation (MHTI) protocol: a pull-based, multi-hop protocol that sends content requests towards the closest infostation. Requests can be satisfied before reaching the infostation by any vehicle in the path that has cached the requested content. Our analysis indicates that the performance of push- and pull-based protocols is only satisfactory in scenarios with a low number of contents or highly popular ones, while MHTI also exhibits a good performance with a large number of contents, and it takes advantage from different content popularities to obtain a high number of contents through the VANET.},

Each customer requires different services on a weekly basis. Some services are mandatory, while others are optional. It might be impossible to perform all optional services, and each of them is assigned a score when performed. The challenge is to determine a set of routes, one per day, that maximizes a weighted sum of the total collected score and total working time, while meeting several operational constraints, including hard time windows, maximum riding time, minimum number of services performed, and minimum time between two consecutive visits for the same service at the same customer. To solve the problem, we propose an iterated local search that invokes at each iteration an inner variable neighborhood descent procedure. Computational tests performed on a large number of real-world instances prove that the developed algorithm is very efficient, and finds in a short time solutions that are consistently better than those produced by a mathematical model, and those in use at the company.},

  abstract = {Motivated by the increasing need of the real-world patrolling, this paper studies a practical city-scale patrolling (CSP) variant. In CSP, the police are scheduled to patrol city regions, and the objective is not only to protect public security but also to respond to incidents timely. We use an integer program (IP) to formulate the CSP problem, with the objective of maximizing the police visibility rate (PVR) to improve public safety and the additional constraint of response time guarantee to handle incidents timely. For such an NP-hard problem, existing studies either cannot scale-up or do not provide a bound from optimum. To fill the research gap, we propose a decomposition and grafting approach. We first decompose the original CSP into two weakly-coupled subproblems, minimizing police problem (MinP) and maximizing PVR (MaxP) problem. By exploiting the subproblem structures, a polynomial time approximation algorithm is proposed for MinP, and a polynomial time optimal algorithm is proposed for MaxP. We prove that such a decomposition can provide the 1 − α approximation ratio, where α is the percentage of the police used in MinP. To further improve patrolling efficiency, a grafting mechanism is proposed to integrate the two subproblems’ solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the real dataset of Foshan, a modern Chinese city. The results demonstrate that compared with benchmarks, our approach scales well to city-scale problem instances with fine-grained periods, hundreds of regions, and hundreds of police officers.},

However, warehouse managers may suffer the situation that the new warehouse and an old one coexist in a distribution center. Due to their respective capacities, any warehouse cannot hold all the stock keeping units (SKUs). How to allocate SKUs to the two warehouses is an important decision. It has a significant influence on the cost of combining the SKUs that have to be picked from two warehouses for customer orders. The problem is formulated by using an innovative virtualwarehouse-based idea, the NP-hardness of the problem is proved, and a hybrid algorithm by alternating between the large neighborhood search and local search is developed. Some effective data-driven strategies are proposed to improve the most time-consuming modules of the algorithm. Extensive case studies are conducted and good performances of the algorithm are shown when it is compared with the MIP solver on small-sized cases, and an adapted tabu search and a simulated annealing algorithm on large-sized real-world cases. The sensitivity analyses on key parameters of the problem are made and related managerial insights are obtained.},

It is, therefore, necessary to conduct efficient road monitoring to identify dynamic abnormal situations, especially in peak traffic periods. Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become an attractive solution to this problem. However, UAV monitoring routes suffer from time limitations during peak traffic hours. To optimize UAV monitoring routes during rush hours, we develop a route planning method incorporating spatiotemporal variations in monitoring demand, in which we introduce a team orienteering arc routing problem with time-varying profits (TOARP-TP) and construct a corresponding mathematical model. The TOARP-TP is an extension of an already existing routing problem, team orienteering arc routing problem (TOARP). An iterated local search (ILS)-based algorithm is designed to solve the large instances of this problem. To verify the proposed method, we conduct sets of numerical experiments with the Sioux Falls road network in South Dakota, US, and a case study is applied using Wuhan, Hubei, PRC. The results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our method in optimizing UAV traffic monitoring routes during rush hours. Furthermore, we discuss a strategy for scenario determination and method selection in UAV route planning.},

This paper addresses the critical issue of task allocation in nuclear accident rescue scenario, which plays a pivotal role in the success of such operations. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem, taking into account three key indicators: execution time, radiation accumulation, and waiting cost. To effectively tackle this problem, an two-stage evolutionary algorithm is proposed. Firstly, a solution encoding method and a crossover mutation method is devised tailored to the problem’s characteristics. Secondly, a two-stage search strategy is designed. In the first stage, a fixed population size and shift-based density estimation method are used to quickly converge the solution set to the Pareto front. The latter stage uses an infinite size population to find as many Pareto solutions as possible. Finally, a local search strategy is introduced to improve the quality of solution set. In the experimental section, our proposed method is compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms on nine instances of varying scales. Across five evaluation metrics, the proposed algorithm demonstrates competitive performance on all instances. These results underscore the efficacy and competitiveness of our approach in tackling the task allocation problem in multi-robot systems within nuclear accident rescue.},

In a persistent surveillance task, the drones sometimes cannot complete it independently when some regions are required to be covered on the ground. For this purpose, unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned ground vehicles (UAVs \& UGVs) system is introduced to perform such a task in this article, and the goal is to generate the circular paths for the drones and the UGVs, respectively, to minimize their travel time of realizing a complete coverage. First, the cooperative path planning problem of UAVs \& UGVs is formulated into a large-scale 0-1 optimization problem, in which the on-off states of the discrete points are to be optimized. Second, a hybrid algorithm integrating the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) and the genetic algorithm (GA) algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. The advantages of EDA and GA in the global and local search are fully taken considering the demands in different phases of the iterative process. A simple sweep-based approach is employed to determine the optimal sequence of passing the open points. Then, an online local adjustment strategy is also applied to address the changes of the requirements on covering the ground area. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAVs \& UGVs system can enhance the efficiency of the task. The hybrid EDA-GA algorithm can greatly improve the performance of EDA and GA in terms of the quality and the stability of solutions. The online adjustment strategy is effective to maintain a complete coverage while minimizing the impact on the circular paths.},

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proved to be successful and efficient for information collection in a modern battlefield, especially in areas that are considered to be dangerous for human pilots. Currently, a UAV is remotely controlled by a ground station through frequent data communications, which make the current system vulnerable in a threat environment. We propose a decentralized control strategy while requiring UAVs to maintain radio silence during the entire mission. The strategy is analyzed based on a scenario where a fleet of vehicles is assigned to search and collect uncertain information in a set of regions within a given mission time. We demonstrate that a region-sharing strategy is beneficial even when there is no extra reward gained from additional information collection. Implementing a region-sharing strategy requires solving a decentralized time allocation problem, which is computationally intractable. To overcome this, an approximate formulation is developed under an independence assumption for information collected by different vehicles. This approximate formulation allows us to decompose, by vehicle, the time allocation problem, and obtain an easily implementable policy that takes on a Markovian form. We develop a sufficient condition under which the approximate formulation becomes exact. A numerical study establishes the computational efficiency of the method; only a few CPU seconds are needed for problems with a planning horizon of 300 time units and 40 regions. We further present a case study to illustrate region-sharing behaviors among UAVs while using practical parameter values. Finally, we compare the obtained policy with the optimal policy found using a complete enumeration method for small instances. Under different parameter settings, the average optimality gap ranges from 0.23\% to 19.90\%. The e-companion is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/opre.2017.1590.},

  abstract = {Multi-robot cooperative patrolling systems have been extensively employed in the civilian and military fields, including monitoring forest fires, marine search-and-rescue, and area patrol. Multi-robot area patrol problems refer to the activity that a team of robots works cooperatively and regularly to visit the key targets in the given area for security. Following consideration of the low cost and high safety of unmanned surface vehicles (USV), a team of USVs is organized to perform area patrol in a sophisticated maritime environment. In this paper, we establish a mathematical model considering the characteristics of the cooperative patrol task and the limited conditions of USVs. A hybrid partition-based patrolling scheme is proposed for a multi-USV system to visit targets with different importance levels in a maritime area. Firstly, a centralized area partition algorithm is utilized to partition the patrolling area according to the number of USVs. Secondly, a distributed path planning algorithm is applied to planning the patrolling path for each USV to visit the targets in a maritime environment to minimize the length of the patrolling path for the USV team. Finally, comparative experiments between the proposed scheme and other methods are carried out to validate the performance of the hybrid partition-based patrolling scheme. Simulation results and experimental analysis show the efficiency of the proposed hybrid partition-based patrolling scheme compared to several previous patrolling algorithms.},

In this paper, we present a new approach for real-time patrol route planning in dynamic environments. We first build a mathematical formulation for the patrol route planning problem under a single patrol unit setting and then propose a fast algorithm developed from the cross entropy (CE) method to meet the real-time computation requirements needed for practical applications. We next generalized the result to the patrol team case. Since the size of feasible team routes grows exponentially as the number of patrol units increases, we propose an approximate CE (ACE) algorithm that balances convergence time with optimality. Compared with the CE algorithm, the ACE algorithm can reduce the convergence time by as much as 48.9\% with a less than 1\% performance loss.},

The strategy is derived based on the concept of ,,-optimal horizon approximation. Numerical studies demonstrate that the strategy is adaptive to the generalized security measure by security level function, and has significant performance improvement over the referenced strategies in previous works.

The presented algorithm, termed local reassignment performance impact (LR-PI), consists of an improved task inclusion phase, a novel communication and conflict resolution phase, and a systematic method of reassignment for unallocated tasks. Considering the cooperation in accomplishing tasks that may require multiple UAVs or an individual UAV, the task inclusion phase can build the ordered task list on each UAV with a greedy approach, and the significance value of tasks can be further decreased and conflict-free assignments can be reached eventually. Furthermore, the local reassignment for unallocated tasks focuses on maximizing the number of allocated tasks without conflicts. In particular, the non-ideal communication factors, such as bit error, time delay, and package loss, are integrated with task allocation in the conflict resolution phase, which inevitably exist and can degrade task allocation performance in realistic communication environments. Finally, we show the performance of the proposed algorithm under different communication parameters and verify the superiority in comparison with the PI-MaxAsses and the baseline PI algorithm.},

  abstract = {For water environmental monitoring tasks, the use of Autonomous Surface Vehicles has been a very common option to substitute human interaction and increase the efficiency and speed in the water quality measuring process. This task requires an optimization of the trajectories of the vehicle following a non-homogeneous interest coverage criterion which is a hard optimization problem. This issue is aggravated whenever the resolution of the water resource to be monitored scales up. Since two of the preferred approaches for path planning of autonomous vehicles in the literature are Evolutionary Algorithms and Reinforcement Learning, in this paper, We compare the performance of both techniques in a simulator of Ypacarai Lake in Asuncion (Paraguay). The results show that the evolutionary approach is 50\% more efficient for the lowest resolution but scales badly. Regarding the learning stability and sparsity of the trajectory optimality, the Double Deep Q-Learning algorithm has better convergence, but it appears to be less robust than the evolutionary approach. Finally, in a generalization analysis, the Deep Learning approach proves to be 35\% more effective in reacting to scenario changes.},

  abstract = {Emerging urban logistics applications need to address various challenges, including complex traffic conditions and time-sensitive requirements. In this study, in the context of urban logistics, we consider a vehicle routing problem with time-dependent travel times and time windows (VRPTW), and the goal is to minimize the total generalized costs including the transportation, waiting time, and fixed costs associated with each vehicle. We adopt a high-dimensional space–time network flow model to formulate an underlying vehicle routing problem (VRP) with a rich set of criteria and constraints. A difficult issue, when solving VRPs, is how to iteratively improve both the primal and dual solution quality in general and how to break the symmetry generated by many identical solutions, particularly with homogeneous vehicles. Along this line, many coupling constraints, such as the consensus constraints across different agents or decision makers, need to be carefully addressed to find high-quality optimal or close-to-optimal solutions under medium- or large-scale instances. Currently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in the field of convex optimization, as an integration of the augmented Lagrangian relaxation and block coordinate descent methods, for machine learning and large-scale continuous systems optimization and control. In this work, we introduce the use of ADMM to solve the multi-VRP, which is a special case of integer linear programming, and demonstrate a manner to reduce the quadratic penalty terms used in ADMM into simple linear functions. In a broader context, a computationally reliable decomposition framework is developed to iteratively improve both the primal and dual solution quality. Essentially, the least-cost path subproblem or other similar subproblems involving binary decisions can be embedded into a sequential solution scheme with an output of both lower bound estimates and upper bound feasible solutions. We examine the performance of the proposed approach using classical Solomon VRP benchmark instances. We also evaluate our approach on a real-world instance based on a problem-solving competition by Jingdong Logistics, a major E-commerce company.},

However, human workers need to finish tasks that require high cognitive abilities, which increases the risk of mental fatigue. Fatigue can negatively impact workers and even threaten the safety of workers. Currently, the dynamics of human fatigue model are rarely considered. Hence, it is crucial to develop a dynamic allocation method for human-robot collaborative tasks that considers dynamic human fatigue to ensure efficient and safe human-robot collaboration. This paper proposes a task reallocation method for human-robot collaborative production workshop based on a dynamic human fatigue model. A fatigue feature extraction method from multimodal data and a fatigue evaluation network are proposed to evaluate the current fatigue status of human workers. Based on the evaluation results, the human fatigue model is dynamically updated. If the worker's fatigue state changes, a task reallocation scheme is generated by an improved genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning and the dynamic human fatigue model. The experimental results show that the proposed model and algorithm are effective and efficient, and can provide innovative insights for realizing a human-centered manufacturing workshop.},

This model can solve this problem by maximising the coverage of hotspots with frequencies of high priority locations while ensuring the feasibility of routes. Two constructive greedy heuristics are developed to generate the initial solution of the PPRP: highest priority greedy heuristic (HPGH) and nearest neighbour greedy heuristic (NNGH).

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) approach for real-time rescheduling of rail transit services with short-turnings during a complete track blockage on a double-track service corridor. The optimization problem is modeled as a Markov decision process with multiple control agents rescheduling train services on each directional line for system recovery. To ensure computational efficacy, we employ a multi-agent policy optimization solution framework in which each control agent employs a decentralized policy function for deriving local decisions and a centralized value function approximation (VFA) estimating global system state values. Both the policy functions and VFAs are represented by multi-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs). A multi-agent proximal policy optimization gradient algorithm is developed for training the policies and VFAs through iterative simulated system transitions. The proposed framework is implemented and tested with real-world scenarios with data collected from London Underground, UK. Computational results demonstrate the superiority of the developed framework in computational effectiveness compared with previous distributed control algorithms and conventional metaheuristic methods. We also provide managerial implications for train rescheduling during disruptions with different durations, locations, and passenger behaviors. Additional experiments show the scalability of the proposed MADRL framework in managing disruptions with uncertain durations with a generalized model. This study contributes to real-time rail transit management with innovative control and optimization techniques.},

  abstract = {Railway traffic management focuses on regulating train movements and delivering improved service quality to passengers; however, such efforts are subject to many uncertainties in terms of disruptions and passenger demand on a rail transit line. In contrast to most existing studies, which focus on the rescheduling of passenger timetables in a deterministic framework, this study proposes a two-stage stochastic optimization model for allocating backup rolling stocks (BRS) to storage lines to reschedule the timetable and serve passengers delayed by disruptions. The first stage is an assignment problem to determine the optimal plan for the allocation of BRS to storage lines to achieve a good trade-off between the investment cost for the BRS and the expected travel time of delayed passengers across different stochastic scenarios. The second stage is explicitly formulated as a network flow model to optimize the timetable of the delayed trains on the tracks and the BRS from the storage lines such that the passenger travel time is minimized under each stochastic scenario. To improve the efficiency of convergence, we develop an improved L-shaped method with several accelerating techniques. Among these, we show that the classical integer L-shaped cut can be tightened given the property of the second-stage problem, which can also be generalized to other two-stage integer stochastic programs. Real-world case studies based on historical data from the Beijing metro verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the travel time for passengers.

  abstract = {As urban rail networks in big cities tend to expand, the synchronization of trains has become a key issue for improving the service quality of passengers because most urban rail transit systems in the world involve more than one connected line, and passengers must transfer between these lines. In contrast to most existing studies that focus on a single line, in this study, we focus on synchronized train timetable optimization in an urban rail transit network, considering the dynamic passenger demand with transfers as well as train loading capacity constraints. First, we propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for the synchronization of training timetables, in which we consider the optimization of two objectives. The first objective is to minimize the total waiting time of passengers, involving arriving and transfer passengers. Our second objective is a synchronization quality indicator (SQI) with piecewise linear formulation, which we propose to evaluate the transfer convenience of passengers. Subsequently, we propose several linearization techniques to handle the nonlinear constraints in the MIP formulation, and we prove the tightness of our reformulations. To solve large-scale instances more efficiently, we also develop a hybrid adaptive large neighbor search algorithm that is compared with two benchmarks: the commercial solver CPLEX and a metaheuristic. Finally, we focus on a series of real-world instances based on historical data from the Beijing metro network. The results show that our algorithm outperforms both benchmarks, and the synchronized timetable generated by our approach reduces the average waiting time of passengers by 1.5\% and improves the connection quality of the Beijing metro by 14.8\%.},

The quality of the information collected at a POI is characterized by some sensory (reward) function of time. With limited fuel, the robot must balance between spending time traveling to more POIs and performing time-consuming sensing activities at POIs to maximize the overall reward. In a dual formulation, the robot is required to acquire a minimum amount of reward with the least amount of time. We propose an anytime planning algorithm for solving these two NP-hard problems to arbitrary precision for arbitrary reward functions. The algorithm is effective on large instances with tens to hundreds of POIs, as demonstrated with an extensive set of computational experiments. Besides mobile sensor scheduling, our algorithm also applies to automation scenarios such as intelligent and optimal itinerary planning.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to examine the use of drones to provide transportation security during times of intentional disruption. Due to the nature of valuable goods, their transportation is always associated with certain risks, necessitating implementing security measures to ensure the transportation process’s security. This study aimed to address the security of valuable goods transportation by proposing a new routing problem using drones termed integrated routing and surveillance (IRS) for ground and aerial vehicles operating in dynamic environments. This approach addresses the problem of deliberate disruption in the planning and implementation phases. Risks are estimated during the planning phase using historical data, and routing is designed to minimize risk and travel costs. Drones conduct online surveillance of the solution routes generated during the planning phase throughout the implementation phase. Ground vehicles are only permitted to enter a link if drones assess the risks before their entry. Drones’ arrival times for this assessment of each ground link are determined by non-predefined time windows. Drones can visit multiple ground links if their time windows overlap in the proposed problem. If the drones detect a suspicious agent, they will perform dynamic replanning to avoid the risk source. Additionally, the proposed problem is optimized using new ALNS (adaptive large neighborhood search) and SA-based (simulated annealing) algorithms. The proposed algorithm’s efficiency and effectiveness are evaluated for small and large cases. The results demonstrate the proposed model’s applicability and superiority to ALNS.},

  abstract = {Cash/valuables routing is vulnerable to attacks and robberies, so it is essential to prioritize transport security. This research employs a surveillance drone approach to enhance the transport security of cash/valuables routing. Using drones to identify suspicious and high-risk situations is a secure way to transport cash/valuables. Compared to ground-based operators, drones provide superior advantages such as improved security, efficiency, and accuracy. To this end, an integrated routing and surveillance problem is proposed to secure cash/valuables transport. In this problem, ground vehicles (GVs) and surveillance drones are routed in coordination. GVs are responsible for transporting and delivering cash/valuables, while drones are tasked with monitoring the GVs’ routes. The drone surveillance is as follows: before GVs leave the customers’ points, drones must surveil the GV through the link ahead and ensure their security. Links are surveilled in specific time windows. In this problem, charging stations are considered to swap drones’ batteries. In addition, an improved iterated local search (ILS) algorithm is designed in this study to optimize the proposed problem. The performance of the proposed algorithm is then evaluated in small and large sizes. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed on some key parameters to assess the proposed model. Finally, the proposed approach is implemented in a real-world case study in Iran, with the results analyzed.},

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a critical and vital problem in logistics for the design of an effective and efficient transportation network, within which the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) has been widely studied for several decades due to the practical relevance of logistics operation. However, CVRP with the objectives of minimizing the overall traveling distance or the traveling time cannot meet the latest requirements of green logistics, which concern more about the influence on the environment. This paper studies CVRP from an environmental perspective and introduces a new model called environmental vehicle routing problem (EVRP) with the aim of reducing the adverse effect on the environment caused by the routing of vehicles. In this research, the environmental influence is measured through the amount of the emission carbon dioxide, which is a widely acknowledged criteria and accounts for the major influence on environment. A hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) is designed to solve the EVRP model, and the performance of the hybrid algorithm is evaluated through comparing with well-known CVRP instances. The computational results from numerical experiments suggest that the hybrid ABC algorithm outperforms the original ABC algorithm by 5\% on average. The transformation from CVRP to EVRP can be recognized through the differentiation of their corresponding optimal solutions, which provides practical insights for operation management in green logistics.},

However, few studies have investigated the influences of the UAV operating environment and performance on search and rescue task allocation. Considering the influences of low-altitude wind and terrain on UAV energy consumption and performance, UAV release position (from helicopter) selection and task allocation models are proposed in this study. Given that the detection zone of UAVs is affected by topographic factors, the principal component analysis method was used to determine the search and rescue level at each search and rescue point and the UAV hovering endurance, which was determined using clustering analysis. Considering the influence factors of UAV battery energy consumption, such as UAV performance and low-altitude wind, an UAV release position selection model was constructed and solved via the improved binary bat algorithm which exhibited enhanced calculation accuracy comparing with three other algorithms. According to the release position planning result, a multi-objective (minimization of the total search and rescue cost and number of UAVs and multi-UAV task balance) optimization model was established and solved using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II. Finally, the experimental results indicated that the solution through multiple objectives had no cost advantage comparing with those under the single objective, but exhibited an evident advantage in task completion time through sensitivity analysis of UAVs task allocation problem.},

  abstract = {The increasing number and severity of natural and man-made disasters worldwide has led to calls for more precise and effective humanitarian responses, and the use of humanitarian relief network assessment to reduce disaster uncertainty can play a vital role in the delivery of precise humanitarian operations. In this study, a collaborative truck-and-drone system was developed as a post-disaster assessment tool for use by humanitarian relief networks. The proposed system comprises a drone equipped with a camera that can launch from a truck to collect information from both nodes and links of a post-disaster transportation network. Following drone operation, the truck is used to retrieve and recharge the drone’s battery. To optimize this collaborative truck-and-drone system, we focused on the routing problem with the objective of maximizing the value of information collected from nodes and links within a predefined time limit, a problem made challenging by the need to determine the routes of the truck and drone in an integrated manner. To the best of our knowledge, this study was the first to consider the problem of collaborative truck-and-drone routing optimization with the goal of profit maximization. After formulating the proposed problem as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model, we decomposed the problem structure into a path-based master problem and two sub-problems to allow the use of a column generation (CG) framework to tackle the problem. Numerical experiments were conducted to examine the proposed model and algorithm at various instance sizes that were generated by modifying an existing benchmark, with the results indicating that the proposed algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions with optimality gaps of less than 10\% for all terminated instances within predefined time limit. A real-world instance—the Kartal district of Istanbul—was then used to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed model. Finally, the results of the numerical analysis were used to develop managerial insights for application by humanitarian relief agencies.},

Due to uncertainties in customer demands, on-time deliveries cannot be ensured frequently. The vehicle capacity may be exceeded along the planned delivery route, and then the vehicle has to return to the depot for reloading of the goods. In this paper, such on-time delivery issues are formulated as a vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands and time windows. Three probabilistic models are proposed to address on-time delivery from different perspectives. The first one aims to search delivery routes with minimum expected total cost. The second one is to maximize the sum of the on-time delivery probabilities to customers. The third one seeks to minimize the expected total cost, while ensuring a given on-time delivery probability to each customer. Having noted that solutions of the proposed models are affected by the recourse policy deployed in cases of route failures, a preventive restocking policy is examined and compared with a detour-to-depot recourse policy. A numerical example indicates that the preventive restocking policy can help obtain better solutions to the proposed models and its effectiveness depends on the solution structure. It is also shown that the third model can be used to determine the minimum number of vehicles required to satisfy customers’ on-time delivery requirements.},

This review first identifies the primary uncertainties of TTR and examines their impacts on both TTR and passenger routing during disturbances or disruptions. It finds that only a few uncertainties have been investigated, and the existing solution methods do not adequately meet practical requirements, such as considering the dynamic nature of disturbances or disruptions, which is crucial for real-world applications. Therefore, the review highlights problems associated with TTR uncertainties that need urgent attention and suggests promising methodologies that could effectively address these issues as future research directions.

  abstract = {Many warehouses involved in e-commerce order fulfillment use robotic mobile fulfillment systems. Because demand and variability can be high, scheduling orders, robots, and storage pods in interaction with manual workstations are critical to obtaining high performance. Simultaneously, the scheduling problem is extremely complicated because of interactions between decisions, many of which must be taken timely because of short planning horizons and a constantly changing environment. This paper models all such scheduling decisions in combination to minimize order fulfillment time. We propose two decision methods for the above scheduling problem. The models batch the orders using different batching methods and assign orders and batches to pods and workstations in sequence and robots to jobs. Order picking and stock replenishment operations are included in the models. We conduct numerical experiments based on a real-world case to validate the efficacy and efficiency of the model and algorithm. Instances with 14 workstations, 400 orders, 300 stock-keeping units (SKUs), 160 pods, and 160 robots can be solved to near optimality within four minutes. Our methods can be applied to large instances, for example, using a rolling horizon. Because our model can be solved relatively fast, it can be used to take managerial decisions and obtain executive insights. Our results show that making integrated decisions, even when done heuristically, is more beneficial than sequential, isolated optimization. We also find that positioning pick stations close together along one of the system’s long sides is efficient. The replenishment stations can be grouped along another side. Another finding is that SKU diversity per pod and SKU dispersion over pods have strong and positive impacts on the total completion time of handling order batches.

  abstract = {Business interruption (BI) insurance and backup transportation have been widely used in distribution centers’ daily risk management. If disruption occurs, a firm (distribution center) can exert efforts to resume its transportation, although its unit transportation cost during the recovery process is uncertain. This paper studies how ex ante BI insurance can affect the ex post transportation recovery, and compares BI insurance with the ex post action—backup transportation. We investigate four strategies: basic strategy, BI insurance strategy, backup transportation strategy, and mixed strategy (integration of the last two). The distribution center that seeks the least profit loss prefers the mixed strategy to other three strategies. However, the mixed strategy might in turn require longer transportation recovery time than the BI insurance strategy. The BI insurance and transportation recovery are complementary, but the BI insurance and backup transportation are substitutable, the backup transportation and the transportation recovery are also substitutable. We also find that the choice of BI insurance strategy and the backup transportation strategy depends on transportation market, insurance market and distribution center’s operational environments.},

  abstract = {Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are economic, have good maneuverability, and can perform some complex and high-risk tasks such as maritime supervision, leading to reduced costs and casualties. In this study, we investigate the application of USVs in maritime patrols, considering the endurance constraints of the USVs and the time constraints. Additionally, we establishes a mathematical model for optimizing the patrol path of multiple USVs under the endurance and time constraints. Considering the complexity of the model, the logistic map is introduced into the immune algorithm (IA) to improve the optimization. Then according to the relevant constraints, the corresponding coding and decoding methods are designed. Finally, the mutation and crossover operators of the genetic algorithm (GA) are combined with the designed IA to improve the diversity of antibodies in the iterative process, thereby improving the optimization ability of the algorithm. In the final numerical simulation experiment verification, the improved IA with GA (IA–GA) is compared with the traditional IA, GA, PSO-GA (Particle Swarm and Genetic hybrid algorithm) and IA–GA-greedy (IA–GA with greedy attribute) through simulations and case analysis. The results show that the improved IA can find a better solution than other algorithms in a reasonable time, which proves the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates some cooperative Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) executing both visiting tasks and transportation tasks. The UAVs are subject to random shocks which may harm both the cargoes on the UAVs and the UAVs themselves. In case an UAV is destructed, subsequently, all the cargoes it carries will be damaged. Furthermore, if only some cargoes on an UAV are damaged but the UAV itself is still functional, then the UAV can still continue its visiting tasks. In order to reduce the probability of UAV destruction, an UAV is allowed to abort its task if it is found to have suffered too many shocks after finishing the visit of a certain number of targets. For each given strategy of UAV routing and loading, the optimal aborting strategy needs to take into consideration both the expected cost due to UAV destruction and the expected cost due to unfinished tasks. Eventually, the optimal UAV routing and loading strategy can be solved assuming that the optimal aborting strategy is always adopted, with the objective to minimize the total cost of UAVs destruction, total cost of damaged cargoes, and the expected cost of unvisited targets. Monte Carlo simulation is applied to evaluate the cost of damaged cargoes, and tabu search algorithm is employed to optimize the routing of UAVs. Case studies are shown to illustrate the application of the framework.},
